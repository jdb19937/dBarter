    On 4/15/2001, the U.S. tax system will still have _all_ of the
    following features:
     1. _multiple brackets:_ there will be at least three different
        marginal tax rates; which one is applied depends on the quantity
        and type of income
     2. _marriage penalty:_ all else being equal, there exist cases where,
        for N < 200000, a husband and wife, each of whom earns N dollars,
        pays more in federal income taxes than two single people, each
        earning N dollars
     3. _income sources:_ wages, interest, dividends, and capital gains
        from investments will all be considered taxable income
     4. _withholding:_ employers must withhold estimated income taxes from
        wages paid to their employees
     5. _mortgage interest deduction:_ at least some of the interest paid
        on home mortgages will be deductible from income
     6. _no national sales tax/VAT:_ there will be no additional
        *national* sales tax or "value added tax" imposed on non-luxury
        goods sold at retail. (Taxes already in existence on 4/15/1995
        don't count here).
        
    Note that changes in individual tax rates, bracket boundaries, or
    exemption/deduction amounts do not count as "changes" since they do
    not affect the deep structure of the tax system.

Claim ID:      13Gy
Creation Date: 1995/09/07
Due Date:      TBD

 
   The Claim
   
    The universe is older than 13 Giga years. YES coupons pay $1 if and
    when it is judged that measurements of cosmological and astrophysical
    parameters lead to a calculated age for the universe greater that 13.0
    billion years at the 95% confidence level. NO coupons will likewise
    pay $1 if and when a calculation gives an age of less than 13.0
    billion years at 95% confidence. If any measurement essential to the
    calculation remains controversial the judge must wait for independent
    confirmation. If some other calculation contradicts the result then
    judgement cannot be made until the discrepancy has been resolved to
    the satisfaction of the majority of professional astronomers. The
    judge will base his decision on published papers and preprints, and on
    acceptance of the results by a majority of cosmologists and
    astrophysicists.
    
   Clarification
   
    The age of the universe is defined as the largest possible value of
    proper time integrated along a timelike geodesic from the Earth at the
    present epoch back to the big bang. In performing the calculation of
    the universe's age it is acceptable to assume that general relativity
    and other well established physical theories are correct and that the
    universe is effectively homogeneous and isotropic at large scales
    (unless there is significant evidence to the contrary). Uncertainty
    due to effects of quantum gravity can be assumed to be insignificant.
    It is not acceptable to assume that the cosmological constant is zero
    or make any other assumptions about cosmological parameters, such as
    matter density, without taking into account uncertainty in their
    measured value or limits. It is not acceptable to make unsupportable
    extrapolations or to rely on fine tuning arguments. It is not
    acceptable to make assumptions based on theories which are not well
    established such as the cosmological inflation theory (unless they
    become well established by time the claim is judged). If the theory
    that the big bang never happened becomes widely accepted by
    professional astronomers and the universe is thereby shown to be
    infinitely old then YES coupons pay. However, in a theory of a cyclic
    universe in which each cycle begins with a big bang, or a universe in
    which the big bang was a local incident in an older universe the age
    of the universe will still be taken as its age since the big bang. If
    it is shown that the universe is exactly cyclic with no big bang and
    the cycle time is less than 13 Gy or if any other accepted theory
    makes the meaning of the claim ambiguous then pay-out is split 50/50
    between YES and NO.
    
   Background
   
    Controversy surrounds two contradictory indications of the age of the
    universe. On the one hand, many measurements of the Hubble constant
    (most notably that based on observations by the Hubble Space Telescope
    on the galaxy M100 in the Virgo Cluster) suggest an age of the
    universe of between 8 and 12 Gy. On the other, astrophysicists compute
    the age of stars in globular clusters to be about 14 to 16 Gy. The
    claim will not be settled until this controversy has been resolved.

Creation Date: 1998/07/12
Due Date:      2001/04/16

 
    The U.S. federal government will, for a period of no less than 90
    consecutive days prior to April 15, 2001, either:
    1) ban premature distributions (sometimes called early withdrawals or
    early distributions) from Individual Retirement Accounts,
    2) require a waiting period of 90 days or more between the date of
    request for a premature distribution from an Individual Retirement
    Account and the date on which the assets withdrawn are made available
    to the requestor, or
    3) increase the additional (penalty) tax on a premature distribution
    from an Individual Retirement Account to a rate of 30% or more. This
    claim refers to Individual Retirement A_ccount_s, which are one, but
    not the only, type of Individual Retirement A_rrangement_.
    
    For purposes of this claim, "Individual Retirement Account" has the
    meaning defined in IRS Publication 590, Individual Retirement
    Arrangements (IRAs); Chapter 2 - When and How Can an IRA Be Set Up?,
    "Kinds of IRAs", "Individual Retirement Account" as of July 1, 1998.
    
    As of July 1, 1998, the additional tax on premature distributions from
    Individual Retirement Accounts is 10%.
    
    Notes: This claim refers to a potential US government action to
    prevent a run on banks. It is one of many emergency actions the US
    government might use to cope with effects of Year 2000 (Y2K) computer
    problems. However, no part of the claim depends on whether a Y2K
    problem occurs or whether any of the events listed in the claim
    description is related to a Y2K problem. The claim owner expects that,
    for various reasons, people and organizations will be reluctant, or
    refuse, to admit that Y2K problems are among the causes of or reasons
    for some events.

 2^(S^.99) on all problems of size S, for all large S. Probabilistic
 algorithms are allowed, if the expected run time on each problem is
 less than the limit. A probabilistic algorithm must get the correct
 answer at least 90% of the time, and each successive run on the same
 problem must further decrease the probability of error by at least
 50%. The algorithm must be available for public inspection 90 days
 prior to judging. The judge may consider empirical evidence,
 especially if a plausible, but unproven, algorithm is offered.

 The problem is to solve every Diophantine Equation in 3 variables. [A 
 Diophantine Equation sets a polynomial with integer coefficients
 equal to 0. In the 3 variable case, P(x,y,z)=0. Solutions x,y,z must
 be integers; negative numbers are allowed. An example of a hard
 Diophantine Equation is x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 30 = 0.] We want an
 algorithm that, given any such equation, reports the NUMBER of
 solutions (which will sometimes be zero or infinity). By the end of
 the year 2050, either an algorithm will be proven, or the problem
 will be proven undecidable. The conditions of the Claim are the same

 By 31 December 2005, at least one new state will have been admitted
 to the United States of America. This claim will be judged true if
 any new state is admitted. This includes a new state on land now part 
 of the US but not now a state, such as the District of Columbia or
 Puerto Rico; the division of a current state into two or more states
 (as allowed in the US constitution); or the admission of new
 territory into the US as a state. New land added as a territory, or a 
 new protectorate or UN trust territory, would not satisfy this claim. 
 (If one or more current states leave, and a new state is later added, 
 the claim will be judged YES: despite the claim abbreviation, the key 
 point is that a state has been added, not the total number of states
 in the US. However, a failed secession attempt, in which the new
 state is the same as a current state, does not count. For the
 purposes of this claim, "now" means 15 November 1995.) If two or more 
 states combine to become a single state, that will not affect this
 claim.

 declaration induced by Australia's involvement in a war offshore, or
 by an aggressive military action by any nation whose government is
 recognized by the United Nations, or as a response by such a nation
 to a declaration of war made by the Australian government. Such a

 This claim shall be judged TRUE if there is a law in the USA that 
 makes first trimester abortion illegal, and someone is convicted  of
 first trimester abortion based on the law between 1996-08-01  and
 2010-01-01.  If there is no such conviction by 2010-01-01, the claim  
 shall be judged FALSE. 
 
 If an appeal is filed within 3 months of the conviction (or of  the
 previous appeal), the result of the appeal  (if before 2010-01-01)
 shall be used to judge the claim.  If a court  refuses to hear the
 appeal, or the conviction has not been overturned by 2010-01-01, the
 claim shall be judged TRUE.  Early TRUE judgement is possible if a
 conviction has exhausted its possibilities for  appeal without being
 overturned, or 3 months have passed without  an appeal being filed. 
 Early FALSE judgement is only  possible if the USA ceases to exist. 
 In no event shall judicial activity on or after 2010-01-01 local time

    An exhaustive, repeatable, scientific study will conclude that
    astrology is a statistically significant predictive method to describe
    an individual's personality traits. More specifically, the claim will
    be valid if the following conditions are met:
     1. The astrological method employs any subset of the following
        astronomical, spatial, and/or temporal data as the input variables
        from which the prediction is made.
           + Date of birth, date of conception: the precision is limited
             to one hour.
           + Place of birth, place of conception: the precision is limited
             to a radius of 100 kilometers.
           + The location of astronomical objects, temporally and
             spatially relative to date and place of birth: "astronomical
             object" is limited to the sun, the moon, the planets and
             their moons, the asteroids, comets, and the constellations as
             defined by the standard astrology of western civilization;
             "planets" refers to the planets of the solar system, namely,
             Mercury, Venus, (the Earth), Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
             Neptune and Pluto.
     2. A statistically significant correlation is found between a
        astronomical method conforming to the restrictions in (1) and a
        statistically reliable personality measure. "Statistically
        significant correlation" is determined by stochastic measures that
        are widely accepted by the mathematical and statistical academic
        community. "Statistically reliable personality measure" is defined
        as the data contained in and/or the results provided by the
        Minnesota Multi Personality Inventory, or equivalent, as accepted
        by the psychological academic community.
     3. The results of a study conforming with the guidelines of (1) and
        (2) is published by a refereed academic journal, which has broad
        acceptance by the scientific community. Further, the study
        satisfies the usual requirements of exhaustiveness, repeatability,
        and scientific rigor.

    The Electronic CAD industry of recent years has been dominated by
    three or four large independent vendors with many much smaller
    players. In 1995 the dominant four are [1]Cadence, Mentor Graphics,
    [2]Viewlogic and [3]Synopsys.
    
    The claim is YES if in five year's time there is a European-based
    independent CAD vendor appearing in the top five world sellers of CAD
    software by market share. Market shares will be ascertained from
    DataQuest or other market reports.
    
    Caveats:
     1. Mentor Graphics will be considered a USA-based corporation even if
        their incorporation is moved to the Bahamas as was proposed at one
        point.
     2. The existence of international consortia such as IMEC are
        irrelevant to this claim because they are not independent CAD
        vendors operating in a for-profit mode.
        
    Background:
    
    From: [4]Electronic Engineering Times (Thursday April 27, 1995)
    _Report Urges Europe to Establish Home-Grown EDA vendor_
    By Peter Clarke
    
    BRUSSELS -- Europe should form a world-class systems EDA company to
    compete against Cadence, Mentor Graphics, Viewlogic and Synopsys. If
    necessary, the company should partner with a U.S. vendor to give it
    global reach.
    
    That's one conclusion of a report that has been prepared for the
    European Commission's Directorate General III, which oversees the
    commission's technology initiatives.
    
    The Cornu Report--named after Josef Cornu, chief technologist at
    telecommunications company Alcatel and chairman of the panel that
    produced the study--notes that while publicly funded programs have
    allowed Europe to catch up in basic silicon-processing technology, the
    continent is dependent on U.S. suppliers of CAD tools. The report
    alleges that U.S. EDA vendors' tendency to develop systems-level ideas
    in tandem with U.S.-based customers leaves European systems companies
    out of the decision-making loop.
    
    The study warns that the limited scope of cell libraries and
    licensable cores in Europe will hamper future European
    competitiveness.
    
    "There should be a new European player in the CAD market," the report
    states. "The battle for layout tools must be deemed to have been lost.
    The approach might be for the European semiconductor companies and the
    systems companies to combine as shareholders in a new European
    systems-level CAD company. It would develop and market CAD tools for
    its shareholders and for the open market."

    "Intelligent" self-driving road vehicles (defined below) enter
    widespread usage somewhere in the world by the end of 2010.
    
    To qualify for the purposes of this claim, a self-driving vehicle must
    satisfy the following criteria:
     1. It must be reliably able to follow a non-straight road at a speed
        of at least 50 mph (80.5 kph) without input from a human driver.
        Furthermore, this autonomous operation must be legal in the
        state/country in which the vehicle resides.
     2. It must have a passenger/cargo capacity of at least 300 kg.
     3. It must be practically and legally able to travel on roads
        commonly used by cars and trucks and to mingle with normal road
        traffic. However, it need not operate autonomously while doing
        this. Thus, a car which requires an active human driver under most
        conditions, but can operate autonomously on a special highway or
        in a special lane, may qualify for the purposes of the claim.
     4. While driving autonomously, the vehicle may use any sort of
        landmarks or beacons to navigate. However, it may not be towed,
        pushed, pulled, or physically constrained to follow the desired
        path. Thus, a vehicle towed or carried by another vehicle or a
        conveyor belt, or running on rail track, etc., does not qualify.
        
    Autonomous retrofits of previously manufactured non-autonomous
    vehicles may qualify for this claim.
    
    This claim will be judged YES if the judge finds evidence that at
    least 10,000 such vehicles have been manufactured and are in operation
    before December 31, 2010. Otherwise it will be judged NO.

    After the death of Deng Xiaoping will China remain whole or will the
    provinicial goverments not recognized any clear successor and take the
    opportunity to break into seprate nation states. To answer yes at
    least two portions of China, not counting Taiwan, must have their own,
    unrelated governments. For the answer to be judged yes one of two
    conditions must be met.
     1. The two states recognize no common institute to which they are
        responsible. This condition can occur if one of the two states
        claims independence even if the other state does not recognize it
        as independent. Each government however has to have real control
        over their perpective states. E.g., Taiwan and the Peoples
        Republic of China would count if Taiwan was included.
     2. The two states have a union along the lines of the EU but
        recognize each other as independent and each seek international
        recognition.
        
    The breakup must be clearly defined within five years of Deng
    Xiaopeng's death or after the formation of the country has stabilized,
    whichever comes first. For example if after five years it is unclear
    who is in charge of some portion of China the decision will wait until
    the situation resolves. Furthermore if a new government is formed and
    clearly in power for more than five years after his death any later
    break up does not count.

    A cryptographic key of 128 bits or longer will be broken, by

    128 bits, but with less than 128 bits of entropy, do not count
    (crippled keys). The results and method of the cracking must be made
    public. This claim makes no attempt to guess what has been done in
    private by governments or other organizations. By "exhaustive" or
    "brute force" search of an N bit key space, I mean the following:
     1. There are 2^N equi-probable decryption keys (1% maximum
        variation), up to 1% can be unused because of weak keys etc.
     2. The actual key must have been generated randomly or from a strong
        hash function.
     3. The keys are tested systematically or randomly, noting only
        whether each key succeed in decrypting the message.
     4. The key must not have been chosen to have any special form
        designed to make this attack easy (e.g. the key 0000...0001). This
        is a judgement call.
        
    On average, the correct key should be found after searching half the
    possible keys. Known plaintext may be used to check the trial
    encryptions. Toy ciphers (in the judge's opinion) do not qualify. This
    is intended to eliminate things like "ROT 13" and simple XOR with a

 maximum of 1 and a minimum of 0, where X is the first year, 1995 or
 later, in which the Democratic Party controls the U.S. House of

  The Democratic Party is said to control the House of Representatives 
 when there are more Representatives belonging to the Democratic Party 
 than Representatives belonging to all other parties and independents

  If the Democratic Party changes its name before it controls the
 House, YES coupons pay 0. 
 
  Note that at the time of creation of this claim, members of the U.S. 
 House elected in November do not take their seats until the following 
 January. Thus, (barring any changes to this procedure), if Democrats
 first won control of the House in the November 2006 election, they

    1. The Democratic party of the United States _adopts_ a party plank
    stating that it is against the practice of abortion.
    
    2. The Republican party of the United States _removes_ its party plank
    stating that it is against the practice of abortion.
    
    The claim is YES only if both occur Background:
    George McKenna has written an oped piece in the September 1995
    _Atlantic Monthly_ entitled ``How Lincoln Might have Dealt With
    Abortion -- A Pro -Choice Anti-Abortion Approach.'' He argues through
    an analogical analysis that, by rights, the Democratic party is the
    proper home for opposition to abortion. His vehicle is the debate
    surrounding slavery leading up to the Civil War and in particular,
    Lincoln's position statements and most importantly his changes in
    position as the war progressed.
    
    McKenna argues that focus of the two American parties has flipped
    since the Civil War. In that era the Democratic party was the home of
    unbridled individualism (with the ultimate property right being the
    right to own other humans) while the Republicans sought to control and
    moderate individual's rights and set a moral tone (and in particular
    to remove the right to own other human beings).
    
    Today the situation is different, it is the Republican party which is
    home of individualist thinking while the Democratic party is
    characterized by the desire to use government to better society and
    set a moral tone. He argues that if you substitute the word ``racism''
    in any given anti-abortion position of the Republican party you will
    recognize a liberal Democratic position. By analogy therefore the
    right to kill one's (unborn) children is the ultimate individual
    choice and therefore the Republican party is the natural home for the
    pro-life position. In contrast the Democratic party of today is
    characterized by interventionist ideas which are used for the
    betterment of society's material and moral well being.
    
    He says in conclusion,
    
      In this debate I have made my own position clear. It is a pro-life
      position (thought it may not please all pro- lifers), and its mode

 This claim will be judged YES if a sequel to the motion picture JUDGE 
 Dredd is released in theatres or on video by 1/1/2000. It will be
 judged NO if no such film has been released by that date (even if it

 meaning of 'in production' (eg Do rumours count?)

Claim ID:      DSdt
Creation Date: 1995/10/03
Due Date:      2047/01/15

 This is a scaled claim. YES coupons pay (2047-X)/50, subject to a
 maximum of 1 and a minimum of 0, where X is the first year, 1995 or
 later, in which the Democratic Party controls the U.S. Senate. Thus,
 if Democrats control the Senate in 1997 or sooner, YES coupons pay 1, 
 while if they do not control the Senate until 2047 or later, YES
 coupons pay 0. 
 
  The Democratic Party is said to control the Senate when there are
 more Senators belonging to the Democratic Party than Senators
 belonging to all other parties and independents combined. Vacant
 seats are not counted towards this total. 
 
  If the Democratic Party changes its name before it controls the
 Senate, YES coupons pay 0. 
 
  Note that at the time of creation of this claim, members of the U.S. 
 Senate elected in November do not take their seats until the
 following January. Thus, (barring any changes to this procedure), if
 Democrats first won control of the Senate in the November 2006
 election, they would not actually have control until January 2007,
 and YES coupons would therefore pay 0.80, and not 0.82.

    Background information: Deep Space 1 is the first deep space probe to
    use ion propulsion and autonomous navigation. It will not be in radio
    contact with ground antennas except when delivering data. This craft
    handles its own course corrections and will make its own decisions as
    to how close to approach study targets, such as asteroids. These
    studies are planned to take place between 6 and 3 miles from the
    surface; the closest approach of an unmanned craft, excluding
    landings. Its planned two year mission is for this craft to study up
    to three asteroids and possibly a comet. The launch took place on Oct.
    24 1998. More information can be found at Claim: Ion propulsion deep

Claim ID:      Drugs
Creation Date: 1998/02/23
Due Date:      2025/01/01

 By the year 2025, in the United States, the possession, sale,
 production, cultivation, and distribution of currently illegal
 substances/drugs for recreational or any use, commonly referred to as 
 narcotics, will be decriminalized, as will be possession, sale,
 production, and distribution of 'drug paraphernalia.' In order to be
 true, all 'hard-core'drugs -- heroin, cocaine, PCP, LSD, in whatever
 form - would have to be decriminalized, not just 'softer' drugs such
 as marijuana. Also included would be any new substances of the type
 listed here that are discovered or created in the interim period
 between the posting of this claim and its judgment. 
 
  Drug paraphernalia includes all drug implements - needles, syringes, 
 etc- which are currently illegal when employed in the use,
 cultivation, sale or distribution of drugs. 'Decriminalized' means
 that while it will no longer be a felony or a misdemeanor to possess, 
 sell, produce, cultivate, or distribute currently illegal substances
 and to possess, sell, or distribute drug 'paraphernalia,' persons
 caught engaging in these activities would still be subject to summary 
 citations, that is, minor fines, such as are issued for jaywalking or 
 other such scofflaw offenses. 
 
  In order to be judged true, at least thirty states or a simple
 majority of federal governmental subunits as exist in 2025 (in the
 event that states as they currently exist have been altered) must
 have decriminalized drugs and drug 'paraphernalia' AND those laws
 must be respected by the federal government; that is, the federal
 government will not attempt to prosecute these actions in federal
 court as violative of federal law. It will not be necessary for the
 federal government to decriminalize drugs and paraphernalia as well.
 (This means that the federal government could still prosecute for
 these actions if they were to take place on federal land, such as a
 military base.)

 The Claim
 
    The _Principle of Event-Symmetric Space-Time_ will be recognised as an
    important principle in fundamental physics by a significant number of
    scientists before the closing date of 20th February 2006. This will be
    judged true if there are at least 100 papers authored by a total of at
    least 50 different scientists, appearing in peer-reviewed science
    journals which cite published articles describing the principle of
    event-symmetric space-time, or physical models explicitly
    incorporating the principle. The peer-reviewed journals may be
    published on paper, electronic or other media but must be serious
    science journals with articles reviewed by scientists. They must have
    actually appeared in final form in the journal before the claim's
    closing date. Citations in a paper which is authored or co-authored by
    an author of the article cited will not count towards the count of
    citations, but can count towards the count of scientists. The articles
    cited may include any published work on event-symmetric space-time,
    even e-prints and web-pages which need not have been reviewed.
    Citations of unpublished articles such as private communications will
    not count.
    
 Event-Symmetric Space-Time
 
    According to the principle of event-symmetric space-time, the laws of
    physics are invariant under any permutation of space-time events. This
    is an extension of the symmetry principle in general relativity to a
    discrete set of space-time events. A more precise statement of the
    principle is that:
    _The laws of physics include a symmetry described by an algebraic
    structure with a homomorphism onto the symmetric group interpreted as
    acting to permute space-time events._ A more detailed exposition of
    the theory can be found at
    [1]http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Phil_Gibbs/esst.htm. I
    plan to keep a list of any citations which count towards this claim at

Creation Date: 1997/05/07
Due Date:      2005/06/01

 
    By 1/1/2005, an Earth-class planet will be discovered orbiting within
    the Continuously Habitable Zone (CHZ) of a star other than our sun.
    "Earth-class planets" are currently defined to be those having masses
    between 0.5 and 10 Earth masses (Me). Planets greater than 10 Me have
    enough gravity to attract a massive hydrogen-helium atmosphere. Those
    less than 0.5 Me are likely to lose any life-supporting atmosphere
    because of low gravity and the lack of plate tectonics needed to
    recycle CO2 back into the atmosphere. The CHZ is bounded by the range
    of distances from a star for which liquid water would exist and by the
    range of stellar spectral types for which planets had enough time to
    form and complex life had enough time to evolve, and for which stellar
    flares and atmospheric condensation due to tidal locking do not occur.
    The currently most used definition of CHZ is the one calculated by
    Kasting, Whitmire, and Reynolds, (1993) for main sequence stars as a
    function of spectral type. These definitions are borrowed from NASA's
    Kepler project (see [1]http://w
    ww.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/summary.html#anchor420488). If the criteria for
    Earth-class and Habitable Zone change during the lifetime of this
    claim (or if similar criteria are developed for moons), the judge
    should try to use the most current definitions. Additionally, an
    extrasolar planet (or moon) that can be shown to have liquid surface
    water and a life-supportable atmosphere will satisfy the claim even if
    it is not "Earth-class" or within the CHZ. Background: over the past
    year, scientists have discovered a flurry of planets orbiting other
    stars (see The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia at [2]http://w
    ww.obspm.fr/departement/darc/planets/encycl.html, or the SFSU Planet
    Search Project at [3]h
    ttp://cannon.sfsu.edu/~williams/planetsearch/planetsearch.html). So
    far, the methods used are limited to Jupiter-size planets. However,
    several teams are working on other methods to find smaller planets,
    using techniques like interferometry, microlensing, planet transits,
    etc. Both NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are planning
    missions to look for extrasolar planets from space. See the Darwin
    project Planet Searches page for a listing of current projects:

      Peter Huber, senior fellow at The Manhattan Institute, took aim at

      work may be largely devoted to handling disputes over

    Before 2010 GMT a number of the following form will have been
    factored. The number must be at least 1024 bits long, and be the
    product of two primes, each at least 300 bits long. The factoring
    method must not rely on any special properties of the number (except
    the fact that there are only two factors). In particular, if the
    factors were chosen by the group doing the factoring, then the
    technique must not have used any information about the particular
    factors chosen.
    
    If a number is factored and turns out to have more than two factors,

    the product meets all the other requirements of this claim, then this
    claim will be judged true.

    Gordon Bell's commercial asynchronous processor exists.
    
    Gordon Bell has offered $1000 for a fully asynchronous processor that
    is commercially available on April Fools day, 2000.
    
    The claim is YES if Gordon Bell pays the $1000, however our
    understanding of the challenge is that
     1. the design must be commercially available
     2. the design must be fully asynchronous (no internally-generated or
        externally-supplied clocks)
     3. the design must have an instruction set architecture (it must have
        a program counter, execute an instruction set and read and write
        to an external memory)
        
    To be `commercially available' means it must be produced in volume
    using a standard process (e.g. MOSIS-fabbed designs do not count). The
    notion of a `standard process' is undefined; In principle `standard
    process' means that a second source for the designs could be acquired.
    The existence of such a second source is not required for the claim.
    
    The claim is independent of the required operating temperature of the
    design (e.g. Martin's previous asynchronous efforts count if it were

    A YES judgment can be pronounced early by showing that the germ-line
    genetic manipulation occurred and _unassisted_ inheritance is possible
    (no in-vitro or other aid is required for subsequent generations), as
    well as being given the _freedom_ to mate (no forced seclusion or
    sterilization). A NO judgment cannot be pronounced early (except in
    the case of Armageddon or some other great cataclysm precluding the
    chance of this claim ever being judged YES).
    
    Recent advances in detection of genetic defects and diseases, combined
    with the much-awaited human genome mapping allow the future
    possibility of detecting and correcting (or preventing) genetic
    defects and diseases before the child is even born or correcting DNA
    mutations directly in the germ-line to prevent future offspring
    defects. Some see this as a great milestone in our future, but the
    ethical issues it brings up could confine the technology to the
    laboratory for a longer time than is scientifically necessary.

 In 1996, Present Clinton directed the United States Air Force to turn 
 off the Selective Availability (SA) feature of the Global Positioning 
 System (GPS) by 2006. GPS is the worldwide satellite navigation
 system used by the Department of Defense (DoD), allied nations, and
 millions of national and international civil users. GPS has replaced
 Omega and will eventually replace Loran and nearly all other
 terrestrial navigation aids by early next century.SA is the
 intentional degradation of the GPS signal by the DoD to prevent
 adversaries from exploiting the extremely precise navigation data
 broadcast from GPS satellites. Turning off SA will increase the
 accuracy of civil GPS receivers from ~100m to ~10m.The GPS industry,
 sales expected to reach $10B in a few years, is increasing pressure
 on the government to turn off SA sooner than 2006. This claim will
 pay 1 if by 1 Jan 2000, the Selective Availability feature of the
 Global Positioning System is disabled indefinately to allow civilians 
 greater accuracy. Otherwise this claim will pay 0.

 YES coupons pay $1 if Gravitational waves are detected at a
 gravitational wave observatory before 1/1/2003 GMT. Detection must be 
 certain at the 95% confidence level according to physicists and
 astronomers in the year 2003 or before. This will be judged on the
 basis of preprints and papers published in the year 2003 or before.
 Indirect detection by, for example, observation of effects
 gravitational waves have on the cosmic microwave background or
 interstellar gas does not count as a YES. 
 
  Information: Gravitational waves are waves in space-time geometry
 predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Possible
 sources of detectable gravitational waves include supernova, neutron
 star collisions, black hole collisions and the big bang. A
 Gravitational Wave observatory with prospects for detection of
 gravitational waves before 2003 is the American LIGO: The Laser
 Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. LIGO is being built in 
 two parts. Construction of the Washington LIGO began in 1992 and it
 is scheduled to begin gravitational wave searches in 1998.
 Construction of the second LIGO in Louisiana began in June 1995. GEO
 and VIRGO are other planned gravitational wave observatories in
 Europe. There are a number of others some of which have been
 operational for years.

 Hillary Rodham Clinton will run for public office in the 2000
 election. Much speculation has recently surfaced regarding the
 possibility of the First Lady running for public office, culminating
 in a Time magazine story citing polls where 59% of those polled would 
 vote for, or consider voting for Mrs. Clinton, should she run for
 office. She can run in any state, as long as her name is on a ballot
 that voters will cast. She must enter a state (ie. state rep, sen, or 
 gov.) or national race (ie. US rep or sen). This claim is not
 concerned with the possibility of her winning in a bid for public
 office, nor with the specific position for which she may run. The

    HIV will not be isolated by midnight (GMT) December 31st, 2005.
    
    The rules for isolation of a retrovirus were thoroughly discussed at
    the Pasteur Institute, Paris, in 1973, and are the logical minimum
    requirements for establishing the independent existence of HIV. They
    are:
    
    1. Culture of putatively infected tissue.
    
    2. Purification of specimens by density gradient ultracentrifugation.
    
    3. Electron micrographs of particles exhibiting the morphological
    characteristics and dimensions (100-120nm) of retroviral particles at
    the sucrose (or percoll) density of 1.16 gm/ml and containing nothing
    else, not even particles of other morphologies or dimensions.
    
    4. Proof that the particles contain reverse transcriptase.
    
    5. Analysis of the particles' proteins and RNA and proof that these
    are unique.
    
    6. Proof that 1-5 are a property only of putatively infected tissues
    and can not be induced in control cultures. These are identical
    cultures, that is, tissues obtained from matched, unhealthy subjects
    and cultured under identical conditions differing only in that they
    are not putatively infected with a retrovirus.
    
    7. Proof that the particles are infectious, that is when PURE
    particles are introduced into an uninfected culture or animal, the
    identical particle is obtained as shown by repeating steps 1-5.
    
    For the purposes of this claim, isolation of HIV shall be said to have
    been achieved if and only if:
    
    1. An article is published in any of the scientific journals listed
    below satisfying the above criteria.

 As of January 1, 2003 11:59pm EST, twenty-five percent of the states, 
 provinces, and territories (S/P/T) in the United States and Canada
 will have legalized hemp for industrial and agricultural uses. 
 
 Percentages will not be rounded up: 25% and above pays $1.00 to YES
 claims, 24.99% and below pays $1.00 to NO claims. 
 
 As of March 4, 1996 there are 63 S/P/T between the U.S. and Canada,
 requiring 16 S/P/T for the claim to pay YES. Should the number of
 S/P/T change by the claim date, that new number will be used in
 judging the claim. Should Quebec secede by the claim date, it will
 count as one S/P/T. 
 
 S/P/T include territories in the Canadian sense (Yukon and NW
 Territories) but not the U.S. sense (Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa, etc.). 
 The District of Columbia is included, unless it is absorbed into a
 neighboring state. (A line had to be drawn somewhere.) 
 
 Hemp can be used to produce fiber products such as paper, textiles
 and building products. Hemp oil can be used for fuel, lubrication,
 paints, varnishes, and cooking. Hemp seeds can be used as food,
 rivaling soybeans in protein content. 
 
 THC levels in the hemp are irrelevant to this claim. Legalization for 
 smoking hemp, a.k.a. marijuana, is also irrelevant to this claim.

 "50% of U.S. Households to have a PC by 1 Jan 1999."
 
 As of the end of 1995, International Data Corporation (IDC) claimed
 40% of U.S. households had a PC, and Computer Intelligence InfoCorp
 (CII)claimed 38.4% (average- 39.1%). With a 4% increase in
 penetration each year, U.S. home PC penetration could reach 50% by
 the end of 1998.
 
 The penetration number will be calculated by averaging the results
 from both companies. If for some reason, neither company is no longer 
 in business, 2 well-respected 3rd party research firms will be used
 for the necessary information.
 
 By PC, I do not intend this to include consumer electronic devices,
 such as the Apple/Bandai Pippin and any future progeny, or the
 much-hyped network computer (NC). As these products become to look
 more "PC-like", it may be difficult to draw a line between these thin 
 clients and full-featured PCs -- however, for the sake of putting a
 stake in the ground, I'll define PCs to have some local storage and
 some applications that are run locally rather across a network (or
 the 'Net). It is expected that CII and IDC will make this distinction 
 while they are conducting their surveys.
 
 Typically, these penetration numbers include personal computer
 purchased both new and used, but do not include home-based PCs owned
 by a household member's employer.
 
 YES coupons will be paid at 1.00 if the claim is judged true. Claim
 to be judged 3/31/99 (since it takes both IDC and CII some time to do 
 their household interviews and release their data.)

    This scaled claim will pay according to the number of internet hosts
    published by Network Wizards for July 1999 in the [1]Internet Domain
    Survey.
    
    For an internet host number less than or equal to 35 million use this
    formula:
    Claim value = ((host number in millions) - 30) * 0.1 .
    The resulting number is rounded.
    Example: 33.55 million hosts are reported. Then the claim value is
    (33.55 - 30) * 0.1 = 0.36 (rounded from 0.355)
    
    For an internet host number greater than 35 million use this formula:
    Claim value = 0.5 + ((host number in millions) - 35) * 0.02 .
    The resulting number is rounded.
    Example: 51.4 million hosts are reported. Then the claim value is
    0.5 + (51.4 - 35) * 0.02 = 0.83 (rounded from 0.828)
    
    If there are 60 million hosts or more, this claim will pay 1.00.
    If there are 30 million hosts or less, this claim will pay 0.00.

    This is a scaled claim with the payoff depending on the date CNN
    announces that a complete DNA sequence for the human genome has been
    determined. The payoff for YES coupons is
    ((year-2001)*12+(month-1))*2. For example, if the announcement is

    expected that the sequence will contain errors; this is not important

    facts established for what will become the nest Indy picture. The
    scooper claims that the next film will be set after World War Two, and
    that Indy will have a wife and a daughter and possibly other family
    members. Sean Connery is planned to return as Indy's Dad. The casting
    would be finished by March, and so the scooper is assuming something
    official will be heard around then. But we've got to say this (because
    we know if we don't, we'll get the email): is the scooper's source
    working at DreamWorks but privy to the details of a Paramount
    franchise?? [Scoop handed in by Stephen Alonzo Jackson.]

 Minister (if one exists) or the Japanese Head of State (if one
 exists); or
 
 b) it is alleged in a publically available speech to the United
 Nations by one of the current five permanent members of the United
 Nations Security Council (US, UK, France, Russia, China) that Japan
 has nuclear missiles and this statement is not publically denied
 within one calendar year by either the Japanese Prime Minister (if
 one exists) or the Japanese Head of State (if one exists).
 
 The claim will be considered false if neither of these conditions is
 satisfied even if it is generally believed that Japan has nuclear
 missiles. It will also be considered false if Japan ceases to exist
 as an independent unitary state controlling at least the island of
 Honshu.
 
 If true, the claim will pay $1 on the judging date, otherwise the

    A good faith attempt will be made to characterize the DNA of the
    Kennewick Man. This will be judged "no" if: 1) The data are
    unavailable to the public by the year 2000. or 2) A proclaimed "good
    faith attempt" does not produce definitive results AND there was no
    attempt to extract DNA from at least two teeth (preferably molars if
    that is the standard tooth for DNA extraction in such ancient remains
    at the time of judgement). In general any proclaimed "good faith
    attempt" that fails to produce definitive results must meet with at
    least the same degree of rigor that was applied by Oxford University
    to the Cheddar Man or by Brigham Young University to the Egyptian
    Mummies it has tested. Some sites that deal with the Kennwick man:

    There will be at least 1000 deaths in a military conflict on the
    Korean peninsula before the year 2003. For the purposes of the claim,
    "the Korean peninsula" means the territory of North or South Korea as
    of 1/1/98 (including airspace and territorial waters), and a "military
    conflict" is a conflict between the armed forces of at least two
    nations. "Nations" are, for the purposes of this claim, members of the
    UN General Assembly as of 1/1/98. Casualties can be any combination of
    military or civilian adding up to 1000, but they must be inflicted as
    part of an international conflict (riots don't count, except in the
    unlikely event that two nations' militaries end up on the opposite
    side of the riot). Casualties must be reported in at least 1 of the
    [1]New York Times, [2]Washington Post, [3]LA Times, [4]USA Today,
    [5]The (London) Times, [6]Le Monde or the [7]Sydney Morning Herald. In
    the event that one of the above newspapers goes out of business or is
    otherwise unavailable, the judge is empowered to choose an appropriate
    substitute. In the event that the judge deems any of the above wording
    ambiguous, the claim will be judged according to the judge's
    perception of the intent of the claim.

    This is a claim based on the Lotto 6/49 lottery (this is the main
    Canada-wide lottery, not to be confused with British Columbia's BC49
    lottery, nor with the Ontario49, Lottario, etc). For the claim to be a
    YES, the numbers "48", or "49", or both, must be present in the
    regular 6 number draw on the eleventh of December, that's Saturday,
    Dec 11, 1999, on the Lotto 6/49. In such a case, the claim will pay
    FX$1.00 on each YES coupon. If the Lotto 6/49 draw is made for that
    date, but neither #48 nor #49 are in the 6 regular draw numbers, the
    claim will pay FX$1.00 on each NO coupon. In the event that the Lotto
    6/49 draw for the specified date does not take place, the judge should
    then specify, in advance, an alternate lottery draw as nearly
    identical to the originally anticipated one as possible, so as to
    settle the claim after the original Dec 11, 1999 deadline. *Note that
    the true probability forecast for this claim is a probability of
    0.232* for the actual fulfillment (i.e. for the YES on the outcome) of
    the claim. The calculation of this 0.232 probability may be found in
    the initial fx-propose mailing list discussion of the claim, in the
    archives at [1]http://ww
    w.ideosphere.com/fx/lists/fx-propose/1220.html. Purpose and Background
    The purpose of this claim is to allow a general comparison of the
    market price with the known probability for the claim, to see how well
    the idea of "price as probability forecast" will tend to hold true in
    this case. A current source of Canadian lottery numbers may be found
    at [2]http://bud.ica.net/. Those interested in more details about
    probability estimates in discrete sampling situations may wish to
    consult Chapter 3 of E.T. Jaynes' textbook _Probability Theory: The
    Logic of Science_, currently available at [3]http://bayes.wustl.edu/,
    Jaynes' formula "3-18" being particularly relevant.

 This claim deals with the maximum megaflops (MFlops) rate achieved by 
 any computer on the n=1000 LINPACK benchmark, as published in any
 issue of "Performance of Various Computers Using Standard Linear
 Equations Software" by Jack J. Dongarra with a publication date on or 
 before 31 December, 1999. The same second paragraph as LA25 and LA30
 applies here. YES coupons will be worth $1.00 if the maximum
 published rate is at or above 600,000 MFlops. YES coupons will be
 worth $0.00 if the maximum published rate is below 100,000 MFlops. If 
 the maximum published rate is between those values, the value of a
 YES coupon will be (MFlops - 100,000) / 5,000. The current peak rate
 is approximately 20,800 MFlops as of January 1995. 600,000 MFlops
 would require a sustained 2x per yer increase. 100,000 MFlops would
 require a sustained 1.3x per year increase. An ongoing U.S. effort
 called the "Grand Challenge" has the goal of producing a machine
 capable of a teraflop (approx. 1,000,000 MFlops, depending on how
 exactly you define it.)

 This claim will be judged YES and pay $1.00 if a Major League
 Baseball Franchise move to a new city is approved by the owners in
 time for opening day, 2000. To count for this claim, the new city
 must be in a different metro area where it would be very difficult
 for current fans to attend -- the San Francisco Giants moving to San
 Jose (for example) is specifically not a franchise move for the
 purpose of this claim. The claim is to be judged when the move is
 approved, which would be some time before the team actually plays its 
 first game in the new city. If the claim has not been judged yes by
 that time, for any reason, than it will be judged no on Opening Day,
 2000 or 4/01/2000 whichever comes first. An expansion team added to
 MLB is elegible for this claim after it has played in its original
 city for at least one season. Background: Althought there have been a 
 number of threats, no baseball franchise has moved since 1972. Bud
 Selig, the acting commissioner of baseball is on record as saying
 that he would not support any franchise move. Despite that, rumours
 are circulating about a number of teams, including the Houston Astros 
 (who just announced they would remain in Houston for 1996), the
 Seattle Mariners, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Montreal Expos. In
 addition, Major League Baseball enjoys a legal exemption from
 antitrust laws, which has prevented owners from going to court to
 move teams. However, this exemption is under Congressional review. It 
 is generally felt that the exemption is not valid, and that it could
 be defeated in court if some owner was willing to go that far.

 Ms.A: Woman major-leaguer by 1/1/06 Background Several men's
 professional sport franchises in North America have experimented with 
 the idea of women players, typically as a publicity stunt. Some years 
 ago, an ABA (the former "other" basketball league) team had a woman
 player who practiced with the team, but did not appear in a real
 game. More recently, the Tampa Bay Lightning (NHL) signed Manon
 Rheaume, who played in one exhibition game in 1992. (She is currently 
 playing minor-league hockey and training for the  Winter Olympics
 Women Team Canada.) However, no woman has yet played in a regular
 season game for one of the men's major-league professional sports
 teams. Claim If, before 1 January 2006, a woman has played in at
 least one regular-season or playoff professional major league game,
 YES coupons will pay $1 and NO coupons will pay $0. In all other
 cases, YES coupons will pay $0 and NO coupons will pay $1.
 Definitions "woman" means a human female, adult or minor, including
 male-to-female transsexuals but not female-to-male transsexuals.
 "played" means, in the case of hockey, basketball, or football, means 
 being on the ice, court, or field as a player during official play,
 for at least one timed interval or play. In the case of baseball, a
 plate appearance OR play in the field during at least 1/3 inning is
 required. "professional major league" means Major League Baseball
 (MLB), the National Football League (NFL), the National Basketball
 Association (NBA), the National Hockey League (NHL), and the Canadian 
 Football League (CFL), as presently organized (including future
 expansion teams) and their successors as may exist before 2006.

 By 2005/1/1 an Open Source Database will exist for which statistics
 published at http://www.tpc.org show that the published statistics
 for an Open Source database will exceed Oracle performance in the
 TPC-D benchmark for a database of 100 Gigabyte or larger in the
 majority of test results for which Oracle publishes TPC-D benchmark
 data( current at the time the Open Source Results are published in
 the same size category for which Oracle publishes data and running on 
 hardware which is identical to the hardware for which Oracle has
 published test results or upon hardware which in the judges opinion
 is demonstrably slower than the hardware for which Oracle has
 published results.) The Open Source product may run on a different
 operating system than the Oracle benchmark case to which it is
 compared. 
 
 
 
  If for some reason the organization at http://www.tpc.org ceases to
 publish performance statistics, the judge may substitute an another
 authoritative source. For purposes of this claim, an Open Source
 database is a product which is distributed in the form tested as
 described above according the the license guidelines described at
 http://www.opensource.org(the organization publishing this web page
 owns the trademark to the term Open Source). An example of an Open
 Source Database product can be found at: http://www.postgresql.com
 
 
 
 Background: The publishing of TPC-D statistics at www.tpc.org has
 been a major component of Oracle's marketing effort. Recently, Oracle 
 has obtained significant press by issuing a challenge by which Oracle 
 claims supremacy in VLDB performance in some specific areas over
 Microsoft SQL Server(see http://wwww.oracle.com/challenge).
 Traditionally, the strong suit of Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase has 
 been in the TPC-C performance statistics which measure OLTP
 performance. Oracle, Sybase and Microsoft are all members of the
 organization which publishes the web page at http://www.tpc.org

 This claim will be judged YES if the Osprey 2 wave power generator is 
 destroyed within one year of its installation. For purposes of this
 claim, OSPREY 2 is installed when it first begins to generate
 electricity. Destroyed is intrepreted as total destruction, sinking,
 damage sufficient to require that OSPREY 2 be returned to a drydock
 for repairs, or intentional scuttling due to damage. If the OSPREY 2
 is destroyed prior to installation or is not installed by 1/1/2000,
 this claim will be judged YES. Background: The OSPREY (Ocean Swell
 Powered Renewable Energy) is a generator that produces power from the 
 action of ocean waves. OSPREY 1 was installed off of the Scottish
 coast on 2 August 1995 with much fanfare, only to sink within weeks
 of installation. The designer claims that the basic design is sound,
 and that OSPREY 2, an exact copy, will be installed in the same area
 by the Summer of 1996. For more detail, see Nature v377 page 6.

    This claim will be judged YES if by 1 Jan 2010 knowledge of a
    protein's amino acid sequence is sufficient to determine its tertiary
    structure in a given medium. Success is defined by the following
    criteria.
    
     1. At least 10 previously unknown protein tertiary structures will be
        determined from amino acid sequence. Any number of persons or
        groups may be allowed to predict structures; however, groups used
        to satisfy this claim must have a success rate of greater than
        2/3. (i.e., if the group predicts 10 structures correctly, they
        must predict no more than 5 incorrectly in the same time period.)
     2. Proteins used to satisfy this claim must meet the following
        criteria:
           + Must be nontrivial in size: greater than 50 amino acids
           + Must be nontrivial in composition: more than 8 different
             amino acid residues within the predicted structure
           + Must differ by at least 25% of amino acid sequence from known
             structures in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank and from other
             structures previously predicted but not evaluated against
             experimental evidence
           + Must occur naturally: designed proteins are not acceptable
           + Must not consist of all alpha-helix or all beta-strand/sheet.
     3. A structure is considered correctly predicted if the average RMS
        deviation of all backbone and side-chain atoms (excluding
        hydrogens) is less than .25 Angstroms or within the error bars of
        the experimental method used to determine the structure, whichever
        is worse. Any medium is acceptable-correctly determining crystal,
        solution, or vacuum structure satisfies this claim.
     4. Correctly predicting the structure of a region within a larger
        protein is acceptable, provided the region meets the criteria in
        (2) above and the predicted region is indicated before
        experimental determination of the structure.

    The US census has projected that non-Hispanic whites will become a

    overly conservative in estimating how fast the racial shift of
    population in the US will occur. This claim is judged "YES" if:
     1. The US census reports that the minority of the population in the

        non-Hispanic before 2060.
     2. The US census ceases to report statistics on race for any reason

     3. The borders of the US change in such a way that some portion
        containing more than 1% of the population of the lower 48 states
        and the District of Columbia is no longer reported on by the US

 Claim:
 
 As of January 1, 2030, the United States will effectively be a
 smoke-free society. 
 
 Background:
 
 According to the CDC, smoking prevalence among U.S. adults (18 and
 older) declined from 42.4 percent of the overall population in 1965
 to 25.5 in 1994, and that downward trend is continuing. Daily smoking 
 rates for high school seniors in the United States, however, have
 been climbing since 1992, especially among females.
 
 Judging Criteria:
 
 This claim will be judged TRUE if the United States is effectively a
 smoke-free society by January 1, 2030. That means that 5 percent or
 less of the population smokes tobacco products on a regular basis as
 of the January 1, 2030. If these conditions are fulfilled, YES claims 
 will pay $1. If these conditions are not fulfilled, NO claims will
 pay $1.
 
 Intent:
 
 This claim predicts that the habit of tobacco smoking as it has been
 known over the past several centuries will all but cease by 2030. It
 should not be construed as an attempt to judge the rate of nicotine
 addiction in the U.S.
 
 Definition of Terms:
 
 1.) "U.S. Population": 5 percent or less of the overall population
 aged 12 or higher of the United States of America, as measured by the 
 latest widely respected statistical research or polling source (CDC,
 Gallup, CBS, etc.) available at the judging date. Specific prevalence 
 rates for various segments of the population (women, men, minorities) 
 may be higher than 5 percent as long as the aggregate rate for the
 population as a whole is 5 percent or less.
 
 2.) "Tobacco Products": Cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars, or any
 other form of smoked tobacco or smoking product containing tobacco.
 This DOES NOT include smokeless tobacco, smoking products that do not 
 contain tobacco in any quantity (marijuana, opium, etc.) or nicotine
 delivery systems such as patches, injections, gums or pills. 
 
 3.) "Regular Basis": The rate specified by the statistical source
 chosen for the judging of the claim; however, this rate must be at
 least the yearly consumption of one serving of a tobacco product (1
 cigarette, 1 cigar, 1 gram pipe tobacco, etc.).
 
 Extenuating circumstances:
 
 1.) Tobacco Bans: This claim shall be judged TRUE immediately upon
 the complete banning, either by the federal government or by the
 governments of every state in the union, of tobacco smoking products
 before the judging date. This ban must be complete; tobacco smoking
 products must be completely criminalized and removed from commercial, 
 medical or religious availability.
 
 2.) Demise of the United States: This claim shall be judged FALSE
 immediately upon any date before the judging date where either a.)
 the United States of America should cease to exist as a nation; or
 b.) the entire population of the United States of America should
 cease to exist.
 
 3.) Differing Results: The statistical data upon which this claim is
 based will be based on the most recently released data for as of
 January 1, 2030. Should different statistical sources announce
 different results of smoking prevalence, this claim shall be judged
 TRUE if any one of those sources announces a rate of 5 percent or
 less.
 
 Effective dates of claim:
 
 Except in the event of the extenuating cirumstances named and
 outlined above, this claim may only be judged after midnight GMT on
 January 1, 2030. Judgements made after that time will be based on
 data available as of January 1, 2030. Even if smoking prevalence
 falls to 0 percent prevalence before the judgement date, the claim
 could still be judged FALSE if the prevalence rate returns to above 5 
 percent by the judgement date.

 A long term goal of many researchers and space frontier advocates is
 to develop the mining and use of space materials (to make rocket
 propellants, spacecraft, satellites, and human settlements, etc.),
 avoiding having to launch the needed materials out of earth's gravity 
 field; this is particularly important for large scale applications
 such as very large satellites or human habitats.
 
 YES coupons pay FX$1.00 if the "outer space derived" mass of
 commercial, industrial or military products for any 365 day period
 ending before 2040/01/01 GMT exceeds 1000 metric tonnes, $0.00
 otherwise. For the purposes of this claim, "outer space derived mass" 
 refers to that portion of the mass of products that comes from
 off-earth sources, and that *stays* in outer space for the 365 day
 period being considered, whether in orbit, or in an orbital structure 
 such as a geostationary cable, or on the moon, or on another
 planetary object besides the earth. Capital production, i.e. the
 production of more factories using space derived resources, should be 
 counted as products contributing to the fulfillment of the claim
 target. Also, mine tailings (such as lunar soil after O2 extraction), 
 should not be included, even if used "as is" for radiation shielding
 or other purposes.
 
 To properly fulfill the 1000 tonne production requirement, the mass
 of any materials taken from planet Earth should not be counted,
 although such materials may form a portion of particular products or
 constructions. Further, if exact production figures are not available 
 for any reason, the "SMine" claim judge should follow the most
 reasonably conservative estimates available, delaying any judging of
 the claim "as satisfied" until reasonably sure that the 1000 tonne
 target has been reached. In addition, it should be understood that
 the space-derived product mass being estimated should involve more
 than just raw materials or tailings being scooped or moved around or
 packaged - the fine-grained structure of such materials should be
 specifically altered for some final use, on the millimeter scale or
 smaller, before being counted for this claim.
 
 BACKGROUND: The Space Studies Institute (SSI), is devoted to
 developing the technologies for bringing about a large scale use of
 space resources. The basic idea here is that a system of mines and
 factories, based on more-or-less ordinary factory robots or other
 devices, could replicate itself quite rapidly, doubling production on 
 the order of every two months, so that a really large scale output
 could be reached in as little as 2 years. See, for example, SSI
 founder Gerard K. O'Neill's "Alternative Plan for U.S. National Space 
 Program" at http://www.ralentz.com/old/space/ssi/alt-plan.html -
 outlining a plan that would require *100 times* the 1000 tonne
 "SMine" production level! Molecular nanotechnology may help greatly
 with the success of this or similar plans - for a discussion of this, 
 particularly in relation to space settlements, see

 A U.S. Space Shuttle will suffer a disaster on a mission between 18
 Apr 1995 (creation date of this claim) and 1 Jan 2000. For the
 purposes of this claim, a disaster is any event that results in the
 death of one or more persons, total destruction of an orbiter, damage 
 to an orbiter sufficient to render it permanently unflyable,
 unrecoverablility of an orbiter in earth orbit, or any combination of 
 the above. Cause is irrelevant- human error, mechanical failure,
 sabotage, etc. are all acceptable. A mission begins at main engine
 start and ends when the orbiter has stopped after landing. Natural
 death of an astronaut during a mission (i.e., heart attack, stroke,

Claim ID:      Smoke2
Creation Date: 1998/03/31
Due Date:      2000/01/01

 Beginning January 1, 1998, California's smoke-free workplace law was
 extended to include bars, taverns and gaming clubs, making California 
 the first state in the US to ban smoking in virtually all public
 places. There is significant opposition to this ban and many groups
 will likely attempt to overturn it in various ways.
 
 This claim will be judged YES if smoking is legally permitted in at
 least 50% of the bars, taverns and gaming clubs in California for a
 total of at least 30 days during 1999.
 
 There are a small number of exceptions in the existing law (for
 example, a bar owner with no employees may permit smoking). The
 intent of this claim is to ignore these exceptions and to require a
 court ruling, legislative or executive (such as CalOSHA, EPA, OSHA,
 etc.) action to permit smoking in at least 50% of bars, taverns and
 gaming clubs where smoking would otherwise not be permitted.

 Suborbital transportation will exceed high-mach air transportation by 
 the year 2020. "Suborbital" means any high-mach, non-orbital flight
 where the majority of the distance is covered without benefit of
 locally available gasses as the primary propulsion reaction mass.
 "High-mach" means the majority of the distance is covered at a speed
 of mach 2.5 or greater. "Non-orbital" means the total flight path
 distance is less than the circumfrence of the earth. "Locally
 available" excludes gasses that have been stored within the vehicle
 for more than 3 minutes. The metric for comparison will include
 passenger, luggage and cargo ton-miles over the entirety of the year
 2020 as published in standard industry surveys.

 Slate is a soon-to-be launched new web-based magazine published by
 Microsoft and run by Micheal Kinsley. It is probably the first real
 venture of Eastern "Old Media" journalism on the internet. Kinsley
 has been roundly critical of current web-based magazines, calling
 them amateurish and worse. It has been announced that Slate will
 charge for access. Suck probably best represts the type of "New
 Media" magazine that Kinsley was most critical of. Self-described as
 "home of barely bite-sized bursts of uninformative bile with the
 depth of insight of a college newspaper op-ed", Suck exemplifies all
 of those qualities that Kinsley finds offensive in web-based
 magazines. Suck is free. Which will the web follow? This claim pays
 $1 if Slate ceases publication while Suck is still publishing. It
 pays $0 if Suck ceases publication while Slate is still publishing.
 If Slate produces no material before 1/1/98, this claim pays $1. In
 the unlikely event that both sites publish their last issues on the
 same day, this claim pays $0.50. To count as "publishing", each
 web-site must be posting original material (not stuff published on
 paper elsewhere or originating at other sites) A site will be said to 
 have ceased publication if it: a) anounces that it is ceasing
 publication. b) publishes no new material in any three-month period.
 The sole except to 'b' will be if a site announces a hiatus of 1 year 
 or less with a fixed end-date and resumes publication within two
 weeks of this end-date. If a site ceases publication with no
 announced return but does resume publication (as did "Life" magazine
 in the print world) it will still count as folded for the purposes of 
 this claim.
 
 If one publication aquires another (i.e. if Suck becomes part of
 Slate, or Vice Versa) the aquired publication will be considered to
 have ceased publication.
 
 This claim will not be judged until one or the other publication
 folds.

 This claim is automatically judged true on Jan 1, 2007. Its purpose
 is to determine how much FX investors will pay for a guaranteed long
 term small profit. Some people have said in fx-discuss that they can
 easily make 5-10%/year in short term claims; if this feeling is
 widespread, the maximum offer to buy T2007 will be significantly less 
 than 99.
 
 Another way of thinking about this claim is that it's a bet that
 you're not going to find anything more attractive to do with your
 cash between now and 2007. Sellers are betting that you will.
 
 Note that someone who sells a YES at 99 (buys a NO at 1) and later
 buys it back at 98 (sells it at 2) has doubled her money.

 If on or before the judgment date it is reported in two or more major 
 U.S. publications that a missile struck TWA flight 800 and
 proximately caused the plane to crash, this claim shall be judged
 "YES." 
 
 For the purposes of this claim "major publications" shall include
 mainstream national (U.S.) newspapers, (including but not limited to
 The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Chicago Tribune, Washington
 Post, Washington Times, etc.) and national news periodicals
 (including but not limited to Newsweek, Time, U.S. News and World
 Report). This definition is explicitly intended to exclude "tabloid"
 papers (Such as the National Enquirer, the Star, the Globe, etc.).
 
 For the purposes of this claim "missile" shall include any projectile 
 class:
 
 A) with a self contained propulsion unit, and B) fueled by either
 solid or liquid fuel, and C) with a self contained guidance system,
 however primitive, and D) designed for anti-aircraft use, and E)
 employed after January 1, 1950 by any military force of greater than
 10? persons since 1950.
 
 Any projectile meeting the above criteria but which is disarmed or
 otherwise modified for training purposes shall be considered a
 missile for the purposes of this claim.
 
 The term "missile" shall include projectiles meeting the above
 criteria and intended for either surface to air or air to air use.
 
 Reports of mere allegations as to the cause of the TWA 800 crash
 shall not be considered when judging this claim.
 
 The presence or absence of a warhead on any missile to which the TWA
 800 crash is attributed shall not be considered when judging this
 claim.
 
 The failure to detonate of any warhead on any missile to which the
 TWA 800 crash is attributed shall not be considered when judging this 
 claim.
 
 The presence or absence of a cover-up as to the facts relating to the 
 TWA 800 crash by any government or organization shall not be
 considered when judging this claim.
 
 The nationality or allegiance of the forces launching the missile to
 which the TWA 800 crash is attributed shall not be considered when
 judging this claim.
 
 To satisfy the claim, it shall be considered sufficient that either:
 
 A) A missile struck the aircraft and caused damage to the aircraft
 proximately causing the aircraft's crash. (The "but for" test shall
 be employed in evaluating this clause. i.e. "But for the impact of
 the missile, the aircraft would not have crashed.")
 
 B) A missile's warhead detonated near the aircraft and caused damage
 to the aircraft proximately causing the aircraft's crash. (The "but
 for" test shall be employed in evaluating this clause. i.e. "But for
 the detonation of the missile, the aircraft would not have crashed.")
 
 If none of these criteria are satisifed on or before the judgement

    YES pays 1.00 if on or before January 1, 2025, the government on
    mainland China exercises effective sovereignty on the island of
    Taiwan. Otherwise, YES pays 0.00. In the following,
      * "PRC" refers to the People's Republic of China.
      * "Taiwan" refers to the island of Taiwan (not including any other
        territories or islands).
        
    For the purpose of this claim, it is considered that in 1995, the PRC
    exercises effective sovereignty on mainland China, but does not
    exercise effective sovereignty on Taiwan. The following reasons are
    cited, and some or all of these or similar criteria should be used in
    judging the claim in the future:
      * An entry visa issued by the PRC is not usable for travel to
        Taiwan.
      * The currency of the PRC is not legal tender on Taiwan. (In 1995,
        the two distinct currencies are the renminbi and the New Taiwan
        dollar).
      * Postage stamps issued by the PRC cannot be used to send mail from
        Taiwan.
      * The country code for international long distance phone calls to
        the PRC cannot be used to make phone calls to Taiwan. (In 1995,
        the two distinct country codes are +86 and +886).
      * The two-letter country abbreviation used in the domain names of
        Internet sites in the PRC is not used in the domain names of
        Internet sites on Taiwan. (In 1995, the two distinct country codes
        are "cn" and "tw").
      * The National Day holiday of the PRC is not observed as a National
        Day holiday on Taiwan. (In 1995, the two National Day holidays are
        October 1 and October 10).
      * The flag of the PRC does not fly over government buildings and
        military installations on Taiwan.
      * In certain major international sporting and cultural events,
        representatives from Taiwan participate simultaneously with but
        under a separate name from representatives from the PRC. (In 1995,
        examples of such events include the Asian Games, and
        representatives from Taiwan participate under names such as "ROC",
        "ROC on Taiwan", "Chinese Taipei", etc).
        
    NOTE: Diplomatic recognition by various countries in the world or
    membership in the United Nations is specifically excluded as a
    criterion in judging this claim. In general, de facto considerations
    shall take precedence over de jure considerations in judging this
    claim. The status of Kinmen Island (Jinmen), Matsu Island (Mazu), or
    the Penghu Islands is not relevant to this claim, which applies solely
    to the island of Taiwan. For this claim to be judged YES, the
    government that exercises effective sovereignty on mainland China must
    also exercise effective sovereignty over substantially the entire
    island of Taiwan (with the sole exceptions being foreign consulates,
    foreign military bases, etc. that enjoy extraterritorial status by
    international treaty). If the PRC ceases to exist, changes its
    borders, or changes its name prior to 2025, the claim remains valid
    and the term "PRC" above shall apply to its successor government or
    organization, which is defined as the entity that exercises effective
    sovereignty over the city of Beijing. That is, in this situation, YES
    will pay 1.00 if the entity exercising effective sovereignty over the
    city of Beijing also exercises effective sovereignty over the island
    of Taiwan. For judging purposes, the following are cited as historical
    instances when particular geographical territories came under the
    effective sovereignty of a different political entity, either
    temporarily or permanently, and either by peaceful negotiation or
    otherwise:
      * 1935 Ethiopia / Italy
      * 1938 Austria / Germany
      * 1938 Sudetenland / Germany
      * 1940 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania / Soviet Union
      * 1961 Goa / India
      * 1964 Zanzibar / Tanganyika
      * 1975 East Timor / Indonesia
      * 1982 Falkland Islands (Malvinas) / Argentina
      * 1990 East Germany (GDR) / West Germany (FRG)
      * 1990 Kuwait / Iraq
        
    In addition, it is anticipated that the following will also become
    such a historical instance, based on treaties and agreements in effect
    as of 1995:
      * 1997 Hong Kong / People's Republic of China
        
    The wording of this claim was frozen on September 18, 1995, prior to
    the start of trading.

    claim.
    
    Background:
    From: Wendell Craig Baker (wbaker@splat.baker.com)
    Date: March 14, 1995
    
    Yesterday's Wall Street Journal (3-13-95) had a very interesting
    article entitled "_Sellers of Unix Systems Adopt Standard against
    Microsoft_" (page B6) on the planned announcement today of the
    so-called Common Desktop Environment by HP, IBM, Novell and Sun.
    
    The article was extremely interesting by virtue of how this
    information was presented by the reporter. ``I think its too late,''
    Robert Enderie of Dataquest is quoted as saying. There was a telling
    little table in the corner:
    
  Unix Falls Behind
  Shipments, in thousands
 
           1994    1998
             actual  projected
   Unix
    1,855    2,195
   Windows NT      555   12,552
   Windows 3.1,
 95  23,833   75,901
 
      Note: Table assumes that NT eventually becomes an operating system
      for server computers linking desktop machines while future versions
      of Windows 95 become desktop systems linked to NT
      
      Source: DataQuest
      
    That projection of 75M copies of Windows 3.1/95 being sold in 1998 is
    interesting. It most likely comes from DataQuest's analysis of Intel's
    production capacity.
    
    On March 8, Martin Reynolds, who is Director of Technology Assessment
    at DataQuest gave a talk at Stanford entitled ``Processors in the Real
    World.'' Most of the talk was on how DataQuest goes about generating
    estimates of what Intel is planning to do. The direction of Intel
    being what controls the destiny of the processor industry at this
    point.
    
    Significant here though was his analysis of Intel's current in-place
    fab capability. He had two slides full of Intel plants that are either
    blowing glass today or will be online in the next 18 months. AMD by
    contrast has just the one plant. Based on the analysis Reynolds stated
    that Intel's plan is to have ship 70 million P6 chips by Q1 1997. This
    will roughly double the installed base of the x86 architecture -- and
    almost half of them will be the 6th generation.
    
    This makes claims that the Microsoft marketplace in '98 will be 37
    times bigger than the whole Unix marketplace a bit more credible.
    
    But the WSJ article was on standards and how the Unix has used them
    and how CDE is going to change that. I was amused that finally the
    reporters had identified the cartel behavior in the Unix marketplace
    (lack of standards, attempts on the part of vendors to differentiate
    themselves from their competitors by making their software unique, a
    strategy of selling computer systems by locking customers into their
    proprietary brand of software, etc.).
    
    Enderle's predictions for DataQuest go on that HP, SGI and DEC are
    expected to ``rapidly adopt'' Windows NT and that Unix sales will peak
    in 1996 and decline thereafter to a level of 1.8M/year by 2000.
    Microsoft at that point is predicted to be selling 22M units of NT and
    99M units of the Windows client OSes.
    
    But what about the extra performance that you get with the RISC
    processors on which Unix runs? Isn't that worth paying something for?
    Yes, Reynolds said it is -- the market will absorb a 2X to 3X price
    jump for that extra 50 to 100% in performance that you get in
    RISC-based systems. But while the RISC architectures currently hold
    the high ground in terms of performance some of them have only
    fair-to-poor ratings in terms of price/performance.

 Before 1/1/2006, official US government sources will claim that a
 major act or set of connected acts of terrorism, war, crime or
 rebellion has resulted in at least 200 human deaths in the United
 States within some 48 hour period. The government sources must
 clearly claim that the deaths involve use of deadly force with intent 
 which originated outside official government channels. A set of acts
 will be assumed to be connected if they are mentioned in the same
 allegations without official claims that they are unconnected.
 
 This claim excludes cases in which the official statements made at
 the highest level express significant doubt whether the deaths were
 caused by acts of war or terrorism or were caused by natural causes
 or accidents. This claim also excludes civilian casualties associated 
 with "police actions", mass suicides, resistance of arrest or
 accidents. The deaths at Waco or Ruby Ridge would both be excluded
 from this claim. Deaths that occur in US embassies overseas or in
 international waters or airspace over international waters are
 excluded from this claim. 
 
 Allegations of an act of terror, crime, rebellion or war must be
 supported by mainstream media including the New York Times, London
 Times, London Economist, LA Times or Washington Post. These
 allegations must not be officially denied or retracted by the Present 
 or his staff within a week of this claim being made.The phrase "in
 the United States" includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia
 and territorial waters with 12 miles of the 50 states and District of 
 Columbia as of 1/1/1997 and excludes all other territories and
 possessions.
 
 This claim excludes "Unabomber" style killings in which a similar
 number of people are killed over a longer period of time. It is not
 necessary that there be an official or public consensus concerning
 who caused these deaths(merely that an act of terrorism is alleged by 
 official sources and not denied by sources higher up in the
 government within a week of the time allegations have been made. The
 determination of the rank of government officials with regard to this 
 claim will be the line of presidential succession.). 
 
 Intent: The intent of this claim is to attempt to predict if an

 A stable transuranic isotope will be discovered before 12:00
 Midnight, GST, January 1, 2005. "Stable" will be interpreted as
 having a halflife of more than 1 million years. A judgement of 0.50
 to both YES and NO will be given if an element is discovered with a
 halflife of more than one year, but not one million years.
 
 It is estimated that, because of the "Magic" numbers for nuclear
 particles, that an element around #114 should be somewhat stable.
 This could be formed by bombarding Plutonium with Calcium. Berkeley
 labs in California and some labs in France are working on this
 element right now.

 Equipment will be on sale by 1January 2001 that enables person A to
 "Travel" to person B's location by the following means. Each person
 puts on a Virtual Travel headset, which is similar to a virtual
 reality headset, and is connected to the telephone system. Person A
 received auditory and visual stimuli similar to those he would recive 
 if he is in person B's location, and person B sees his own location
 with person a superimposed on it. Person A is able to move his
 viewpoint around person B's location. The claim is limited to sight,
 hearing and movement, ie touch and smell etc are not included. The
 price of the equipment for sale is to be less that $1000 per headset, 
 in the USA (including local taxes and any unavoidable extras). The
 claim requires stereo sound with a bandwidth of at least 7.5kHz,
 although compression may be used, and stereo video with at least
 512x512 pixels with 64 levels and color, compression may be used. If
 the video compression results in time judder the claim will be

 Proposition: Voice access will be more popular than keyboard access
 to computers by the year 2020. Pro: In 1996, IBM is popularizing
 voice access in TV commercials. Infoworld finds the software usable,
 but uncomfortable. Startups are making inroads...you can make an
 audio clip for your web page by phone and other innovations are
 expected. Moore's Law keeps making computers smaller and more able,
 so why tote around a keyboard for a watch computer? Con: But can we
 count the keyboard out yet? Trained keyboardists can type a lot
 faster than they can talk. With ergonomic layouts, such as the Dvorak 
 keyboard, efficiency is even higher. Voice recognition is a hard
 problem especially "whenpeoplemuddletheirwordstogether". The keyboard 
 has been around a long time, do not count it out.

    This claim will be judged YES if, by the end of 2030, reliable surveys
    indicate that a majority (>50%) of U.S. residents seldom or never eat
    of the carcasses of any mammals, birds, or reptiles.
    
    Note that this claim could be satisfied if members of the
    "non-carnivore" majority habitually ate any of the following:
      * fruit, vegetables, vegetable products
      * milk, honey, eggs
      * fish, crustaceans, amphibians, insects
      * wholly artificial foods
      * animal tissue not directly requiring the slaughter of animals with
        mental life comparable to that of a mammal, bird, or reptile (e.g.
        if beef steaks could be grown in vats instead of consisting of the
        carcasses of dead cattle, eaters of vat-beef could qualify as
        "non-carnivores" for the purposes of this claim)

    The Verilog language, originally developed by [1]Cadence Design
    Systems and as now standardized by Open Verilog International wins in
    the EDA marketplace.
    
    The claim is YES if Verilog is understood to be a _better_ design
    language that is _more suitable_ for design expression, lends itself
    to _more efficient_ simulators and provides _better_ input to
    synthesis and test compilers relative to its competitor VHDL.
    
    The affirmation of this judgement is defined by this recognition in
    any one of the (then-current) top four independent EDA vendors by
    virtue of their support for the Verilog language to the exclusion of
    the VHDL language.
    
    Currently the top-four independent EDA vendors are
      * [2]Cadence Design Systems,
      * Mentor Graphics,
      * [3]Synopsys,
      * [4]ViewLogic.
        
    Background:
    The culture here is that for many years there have been ongoing
    debates about whether VHDL is ``suitable'' or whether Verilog is a
    ``better'' language than VHDL. To wit:
      * Verilog ``C-like'' (it uses many C-type constructs) and is
        therefore in tune with ``designers needs.'' Verilog as implemented
        by Cadence's Verilog XL product is weakly typed just as C is; you
        get most of your errors at final-link time but not a
        module-compile time. There are many after-market ``lint-type''
        products that fix this. Verilog is therefore a _good_ design
        language.
        Until the advent of Open Verilog International, Verilog was a
        proprietary standard of Cadence Design Systems. Many people still
        think it is as you don't _do_ Verilog until you ``do what
        Cadence's Verilog XL does.''
      * VHDL on the other hand is ``Ada-like'' (it was explicitly derived
        from Ada). VHDL is strongly-typed and you get many errors at
        compile time; your modules must be compiled after all modules that
        they use. VHDL has overloading. VHDL is a more ``complex''
        language than Verilog [see _Proceedings of DAC94_]. VHDL is an
        IEEE standard (IEEE 1076-1987, reaffirmed in 1992). VHDL is also a
        U.S. DoD mandated standard (if you do business with the government
        you must provide a VHDL model of your part). VHDL is therefore a
        _bad_ design language.
        
    This claim is based on a news article by John Cooley
    (jcooley@world.std.com), entitled [5]Verilog Won & VHDL Lost? -- You
    Be The Judge! that reports a purported ``bake off'' of the two
    languages using professional designers.
    
    A copy of the article is also [6]available separately.

 This claim will be judged "YES" if either: 1)  A major financial
 publication (Wall Street Journal, Barron's, or London Economist)
 reports a successful computer theft from a  US bank in excess of
 $1,000,000 (in 1995 dollars to be  adjusted for inflation) by the end 
 of 2010. The theft will be regarded as successful if and only if the
 perpetrator of this theft is not caught, the money is not retrieved
 and the loss is large enough that the bank publicly admits the loss.  
 or 2) A major financial publication(Wall Street Journal, Barron's, or 
  London Economist) reports a major US bank (on the 50 largest)
 seeking FDIC reimbursement for its depositors for reasons that
 include major losses due to computer assisted theft. This second
 portion of this claim would be true even if some perpetrators are
 caught. The bank simply needs to fail for reasons that include a
 significant component of computer assisted fraud.

 This claim will be judged TRUE if Microsoft releases an operating
 system with the name "Windows 2000", or an official rechristening
 thereof, on or before December 31, 1999.
 
 Background: The successor to Windows NT 4, called "NT 5", has been in 
 beta for a while. Its release date has been slipping by relatively
 large amounts; its codebase is rumoured to be in the range of 40
 million lines of code, and Sun's CEO claimed that such a product was
 "unmanageable". It was recently officially rechristened "Windows
 2000".
 
 This claim is not about the name of the system, but about the release 
 of a product that is "built on NT technology". For instance, a
 repackaged Linux pushed as "Windows 2000" would not qualify.

      * A major retail software distributor reports that sales of X.400
        end-user UAs are significant (more than 10% of its category)
        Gateways don't count here.
      * A believable survey shows at least 10% of E-mail traffic in some
        category with X.400/Internet competition is carried by X.400.
        Gateways count; politically chosen networks (like EC offices)
        don't.
        
    The claim will be judged YES if one of the following is true:
      * ITU or ISO deletes X.400 from its list of
        standards/Recommendations in force
      * No major trade association (like EMA or EEMA) advocates the use of
        X.400
      * None of the 5 biggest network operators in the US offer an X.400
        service to new customers (legacy systems don't count)
        
    If none of the claims above are decidable, decision will be made by a
    poll announced to relevant newsgroups.
    If claims both in the YES and NO category are true, the return will be
    divided equally between the YES and NO holders.

 Conclusive evidence of intelligent extraterrestrial life will be

 Terrestrial-origin entities (e.g. colonists, biological constructs,
 computational constructs) whose predecessors left earth after 1900 do 
 not satisfy this claim. If the intelligence of the ET is not obvious, 
 the primary judging criteria will be either a significant level of
 technological sophistication (e.g. radio transmitting capability) or
 conceptual abstraction (e.g. basic mathematical ability). Radio
 signals received or similar tell-tale signs of intelligence (e.g.
 archeological discoveries) detected and accepted by scientific
 consensus as originating from intelligent extraterrestrials would
 satisfy the claim even if not completely understood by the claim

 Claim: that y2K problems will have no catastrophic effects on the
 layman, whether for computer function, internet, bank accounts, or
 stock portfolio.  Y2K buzz abounds everywhere. However, many of us
 think that Jan. 1 (or Jan. 3, which is a Monday) 2000 will come and
 go and that there will really be no catastrophe at all. Judgement on
 this claim is based on a normal person, with a normal savings
 account, checking account, and mutual fund, being able to go into
 work on Monday, January 3, 2000, turn on their computer, log onto the 
 web, get email, and yet still forget to put "2000" as the date on
 their next check because nothing happened out of the ordinary. Minor
 changes in the Dow or interest rates or quickly-fixed computer
 glitches are not considered "catastrophes". Basically, to be true,
 the general consensus must be "so what was all that fuss about."

    This claim will be judged yes if the official figures available from
    [1]Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve-M1 AND ITS
    COMPONENTS-Weekly or [2]Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve-M1
    AND ITS COMPONENTS-Monthly indicate an increase of U.S. currency in
    circulation of at least 10% during some 3 month or 12 week period
    between 1999/4/1 and 2000/4/1. Note: If the Fed moves or reorganizes
    its web page, the judge is encouraged to substitute the best official
    figures available from the Federal Reserve on the United States
    currency supply(or an official agency legally designated by the U.S.
    government to replace the Federal Reserve). If the Federal Reserve
    dissolves or fails to publish any figures on the currency supply in
    the US this claim will be judges yes. If the Fed recalls existing
    currency(i.e. ceases accepting as legal tender currency that was legal
    as of 1998/10/1 before 2000/4/1) this claim will be judges yes. This
    claim will also be judges yes if either the CPI rises by at least 50%
    or price of gold rises at least 150% in terms of currency that was
    valid as of 1998/10/1 in any 3 month or 12 week period between
    1999/4/1 and 2000/4/1(using the London spot price for gold or the
    official CPI figures from the [3]US Bureau of Labor Statisics ). (it
    is the opinion of this claim author that an unprecedented rise in gold
    prices or the CPI would indicate a likely departure from traditional
    U.S. monetary policies that would make the Fed's figures somewhat
    suspect or possible evidence that the Fed had lost its ability to
    control the supply of currency) Background: According to official
    figures at [4]Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve-M1 AND ITS
    COMPONENTS-Weekly the Fed has never increased the currency in
    circulation (a componet of M1) by more than 6% in any 12 week period
    since 1975 or according to [5]Board of Governors of the Federal
    Reserve-M1 AND ITS COMPONENTS-Monthly no 3 month period since 1959.
    The currency in circulation is an indication of the relative
    importance of paper currency to the deposits in demand accounts and
    other components of M1 (a basic measure of Money Supply). The total
    Money Supply as of 1998/09/14 was 1068.9 $US Billion of which 447.9
    $US Billion was currency. In public statements, spokespersons of the
    Federal Reserve have indicated that the Fed would prepare for Y2K by
    having "plenty" of cash on hand(the figure 50 $US Billion has been
    thrown around). More info at: [6]Fede ral Reserve Board Testimony from
    7/30/97
    
    It is the premise of this claim that the cash actually put into
    circulation during the period immediately before and after Y2K will at
    least reach the high end of what the Federal Reserve has stated they
    preparing for-and that placing a significant amount of currency into
    circulation may help measure things like the degree of breakdown of
    the banking system associated with Y2K problems.

    The Federal government of United States will use some form of
    conscription between 1999/7/1 and 2000/7/1 involving at least 100
    people according to reports in the major news media, cited in messages
    sent to fx-discuss@ideosphere.com or a communications channel
    specified by the judge of the claim. The use of a draft or

    manpower for the military but may include attempts to obtain people
    with specialized skills for work in the Civil Service.
    
    For purposes of this claim, conscription will include both 1) direct
    conscription of individuals(i.e. requiring individuals to become
    employees of the US government) 2) indirect conscription-which would
    include freezing people into their jobs via Executive Order or Act of
    Congress. For purposes of this claim, the major news media includes:
    The Times of London, The London Economist, The New York Times, The

    The Y2K bug in short: computer programs that use only the last two
    digits of the year number cannot distinguish between centuries (e.g.
    1900 and 2000) and therefore could malfunction on 2000-01-01 and

    UTC): The deaths may be caused directly by accidents in
    transportation, manufacture, telecommunication, electrical power
    generation, military systems or other fields of human activity. Only
    deaths inflicted by an accident shall count. The judge of this claim
    shall not count deaths from

        actions after an Y2K-bug-caused accident.
      * diseases (whether their spread is connected to the Y2K bug or
        not).
        
    This is a global claim. Relevant deaths for this claim may happen
    anywhere on Earth, in space or other heavenly bodies. Only events that
    come to public attention before the judging date count. If different
    death counts exist, the judge shall estimate the most probable number.
    The claim shall be judged using reliable public information sources

    Yes Coupons pay the percentage of nuclear power plants in the United
    States, Canada, Japan, Germany, The United Kingdom and France which
    are listed in the database at: [1]International Nuclear Safety Center
    (INSC) as Operable of 1998/9/21 which are still listed in this
    database as operable as of 2000/2/15. (i.e. the number of operable
    plants as of 2000/2/15-that were operable as of 1998/9/15 divided by
    the number of plants operable as of 1998/9/21). In the event that the
    above database is not operational or the internet is down the judge
    may substitute on appropriate authoritative source. The intent of this
    claim is to assess what percentage of nuclear power plants may be
    brought down in large, well-developed, politically stable countries
    for a prolonged period of time because of Y2K problems. Another claim,
    [2]Y2Knuk measures the probability of a major nuclear accident near
    this time. Background:
    
      As of September 21,1998, there were approximately 292 operational
    nuclear reactors in France, Germany, The United Kingdom, Canada, Japan
    and the United States according to: [3]International Nuclear Safety

 Between 1999/9/1 and 2000/3/1 at least one of the London Economist,
 The Times of London or the New York Times will report that between
 the dates 1999/9/1 and 2000/3/1 an operational nuclear power plant in 
 the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany or France, will 
 have experienced a significant operational problem. For purposes of
 this claim, a significant operational problem will include at least
 one of the following: a release of radioactive materials into the
 environment other than through usual waste disposal methods, loss of
 life of staff or people residing near a nuclear plant caused by
 failure of the nuclear power plant
 
  
 
 This claim is meant to indicate major newsworthy nuclear plant
 problems(i.e. of nature of Three Mile Island or Chernobyl) in
 countries that are relatively stable at the time the claim is
 written. 
 
 For purposes of this claim, an operational nuclear power plant is
 those facilities listed at http://www.insc.anl.gov/index.html as
 operational in France, The United States, the United Kingdom, Japan
 and Germany as operational as of 1999/9/1. The intent of this claim
 is to exclude deaths in a nuclear plant due to construction
 accidents, natural causes, or accidents not related to an operational 
 problem(i.e. falling of a ladder).

 Between 1999/6/1 and 2000/3/1 trading will be officially stopped at
 least one day upon which trading would be normally scheduled to
 occur,for at least two of the publicly traded, Fortune 150 companies
 according to at least one major financial publication including the
 Wall Street Journal, Barrons, The Financial Times of London, The
 London Economist or official correspondence/publications of the SEC
 or correspondence/publications of the officers of the New York Stock
 Exchange, NASDAQ or the American stock exchange-and reference to this 
 publication will be posted to fx-discuss@ideosphere.com or
 alternative communications channel selected by the judge(and listed
 in the judges statement). For this claim to be judged "YES", trading
 must be stopped on the _same_ day for at at least two of these
 companies in at least one exchange for reasons other than the
 annoucement of a merger or acquisition. Stoppage of trading must
 occur over some 24 hour period(i.e. if trading stops the latter half
 of one day and the first half of one day this counts, if trading
 stops the latter half of two adjacent days this would not
 count--usually when trading is officially stopped because of drop in
 stock prices, the trading will be stopped only part of a day).
 Conversion of a public traded company to a privately held company
 will not count as a cessation of trading.
 
 Trading in major US stock exchanges can be legally halted because of
 large drops in stock market valuation. It is also plausible that
 either a panic in anticipation of the Y2K problem or problems related 
 to the running of the US financial system could cause such a problem. 
 Even if scheduled in advance a closing of the NASDAQ, NYSE, or AMEX
 other than on a weekend or holiday which has been celebrated is past
 years or a new holiday upon which it is proposed markets will be
 closed in future years would cause this claim to be judged YES. In
 the event that any two of the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the
 Financial Times of London, or London Economist suspend publication on 
 the same day making it difficult to determine the exact state of
 financial markets, this claim will be judged "YES"(i.e. similtaneous
 cessation of publication of any two of these is assumed to indicate a 
 sigificant break in financial infrastructure). For this claim to be
 Judged Yes, appropriate information must be published the financial
 publications or official channels listed above by 2000/4/10.
 
 For purposes of this claim the Fortune 150 companies in America will
 be the 150 largest companies listed companies in Fortune magazine in
 April 1998: (available at
 http://www.pathfinder.com/fortune/fortune500/500list.html)
 
 The intent of specifying that citations which might cause this claim
 to be judged "YES" be publicy posted is to remove from the judge the
 obligation to monitor the publications specified in this claim. The
 judge is free to judge this claim "no" unless public objections are
 raised by the judgement date with verifiable citations in the sources 
 listed.

Claim ID:      cryoni
Creation Date: 1997/12/10
Due Date:      2002/12/31

 Cryonics is beginning to look closer to reality with the advent of a
 new hydrocarbon fluid that can replace the blood in a body and be
 used to cool the body very quickly. The fluid is non-toxic, and has a 
 very low freezing point. Extremely fast (>1 degree/minute) cooling
 can reduce or eliminate freezing-associated damage by minimizing ice
 crystal formation. This is a large step in being able to successfully 
 revive a frozen person without the need for nanotechnology.
 
 This claim will be judged as true if a placental mammal of at least
 50 pounds in weight that has been frozen to -100 degrees F (or
 colder) for at least 1 hour is revived without evidence of tissue or
 brain damage, as determined by microscopic and behavioral tests. The
 deadline is 12/31/2002.

 This claim will be judged TRUE if an automatic system (perhaps
 similar to that used in tennis) for making any baseball umpiring
 decision [any of ball/strike, foul/fair, safe/out, caught/dropped
 would be acceptable] is used officially during a major league
 baseball game before Jan 1, 2000. Standard instant replay monitored
 or judged by human officials specifically does not count. The system
 must make decisions during the game; decisions made after the game is 
 over do not count. It is irrelevant whether and how often humans can
 overrule the decision of the system. The system may be electronic or
 otherwise. If MLB ceases to exist, this claim will be judged FALSE by 
 default. 

Claim ID:      iNSP
Creation Date: 1995/05/24
Due Date:      1999/07/04

 
    At his Comdex '94 keynote Intel Corp. president and chief executive
    officer Andrew Grove has called for the standardization of multimedia
    and communications subsystems for PCs. Intel realizes that upgrading
    PCs for multimedia with add-in boards creates complexities for the
    industry. Grove stated, ``Each application ends up tied to its own
    hardware system, resulting in added expense and complexity for
    installation support.''
    
    Intel is proposing `Native Signal Processing' (NSP), as a technique
    that uses spare compute cycles on the main processor to perform
    functions traditionally assigned to add-in cards with digital-signal
    processors.
    
    Later, representatives of AMD, AT&T, Motorola all stated that Intel's
    NSP iniative must be resisted at all costs. AT&T Microelectronics'
    Curtis Crawford has said at the In-Stat conference ``I am not certain
    that it is in the best interest of the industry or our customers to
    allow everything worth doing to be done only on the microprocessor.''
    There are similar statements from the other DSP producers.
    
    Both Intel and the discrete DSP producers cannot be right.
    
    The claim is YES if the bulk of P6- and P7-based systems are seen to
    use the NSP architecture as defined by Intel. The affirmation of the
    claim will be judged by the preponderance of the opinion of the media
    pundits. As necessary the opinions of market researchers (e.g.
    DataQuest) or industry opinion editors (in the trade press) will be
    invoked for the judgement.
    
    Background:
    You may do your own research on the goings-on in the trade at
    [1]TechWeb
    
    In addition to NSP you may wish to understand Intel's 3DR project.
    Intel is giving away the 3DR Geometry Engine pipeline for free (and
    allowing its royalty-free use in products). Intel promises to support
    3DR. The 3DR effort can be seen to bolster the need for more and
    better CPUs -- and thus the NSP architecture.

Claim ID:      immort
Creation Date: 1996/08/16
Due Date:      2015/12/31

 The claim is that immortality will be demonstrated in a placental
 mammal by the end of 2015.
 
 Immortality shall be defined as an organism living to at least three
 times its 1996 known maximum lifespan without signs of senescence
 (macroscopic or microscopic) AND somatic cells from the organism must 
 be shown in culture to have no Hayflick limit, while not becoming
 cancerous, and not changing morphologically.   The organism must be
 alive and functioning at its normal metabolic level during the entire 
 period.   A "higher" organism shall be considered any placental
 mammal that has a previously known maximum lifespan of at least one
 year (large doses of anti-oxidants and some gene manipulations have
 already shown marked increase in lifespans of extremely short lived
 organisms).  The immortality does NOT have to be inheritable, and can 
 be induced from the egg stage, or in a previously existing adult.  
 The claim shall be judged positive if these conditions have been met
 by 12/31/2015.  The results must be published in a reputable
 scientific journal, such as Science, or the Journal of Cell Biology.

Claim ID:      port
Creation Date: 1995/12/26
Due Date:      2010/01/01

 
    This claim is judged YES if and only if, by January 1, 2010, in any
    state with more than 5 million inhabitants, at least 25% of the adult
    population are "portably online". A "state" can be a country or a
    member state in a federation. For a person to be "portably online"
    _all_ of these conditions must be fulfilled:
      * The person must carry a device that provides access to
        general-purpose computing as well as access to a major global
        network. The general-purpose computing power must be good enough
        by the standards of the time to actually use for general-purpose
        computing work. I.e. a HP calculator would not satisfy this
        requirement, nor would a cellular phone unless something like
        [1]the NoKb claim has come true. (Note the key phrase "access to".
        The device itself doesn't need to be more than an interface.)
      * Two different portably online persons must be able to communicate
        with each other through this network.
      * The device must be actually carried along for more hours of the
        day than not, in a pocket, a bag or the like. I.e., if it is lying
        on someone's desk, only the time when this someone is sitting at
        that desk counts. Time spent asleep does not count.
      * The device must not require plugging into an outlet to become
        online.
        
   Background
   
    In the 1980s there was a trend towards portable computing: Computers
    were growing ever smaller and lighter. Today, in 1995, this trend
    seems to have stalled, as it never got the big popular breakthrough
    that at a time looked to be just around the corner. Today another
    portable technology has gotten that big popular breakthrough: Cellular
    phones. Could it be that the combination of portable and online
    computing will prove more succesfull than portable computing alone? If
    so, is that a desirable development?

Claim ID:      road
Creation Date: 1995/05/10
Due Date:      2006/04/01

 
    Congress or a federal agency will recognize that roadway and/or
    highway funds represent a form of subsidy or "welfare" for real-estate
    & land developers and related industries (concrete, lumber, steel) and
    will act to reduce and/or recoup such costs from the specific
    developers/industries. Alternatively, the federal government will
    recognize a need to subsidize the information and telecommunications
    infrastructure, and will create an agency whose annual budget will be
    comparable to the highway/roadway budget. This claim will be judged
    TRUE if, in any fiscal year up to and including 2005, _any one_ (or
    more) of the following has occurred:
    
     1. The federal highway budget is less than two-thirds of the 1995
        budget, measured in real, inflation adjusted terms
     2. Federal matching grants to states for roadway construction,
        improvement and maintenance are less than two-thirds of the 1995
        grants
     3. A federal tax on real-estate development or related industries has
        been enacted, for the specific purpose of supplementing the
        federal roadway/highway budget, and such tax revenues account for
        more than one-sixth of the budget (a tax on individual home-owners
        owners) is specifically excluded from consideration)
     4. A federal agency has been created for the administration of public
        funds for the construction, improvement or maintenance of public
        (e.g. administered by federal, state, or local authorities)
        telecommunications networks (e.g. phone, cable TV, internet) and
        the budget of said agency, and/or of the amount of grants,
        subsidies, etc. disbursed by said agency are at least one-sixth of
        the 1995 federal roadway budget.

Claim ID:      roton
Creation Date: 1999/03/09
Due Date:      2001/01/15

 On or before 31 December 2000 Pacific Standard Time (zone -8), Rotary 
 Rocket, or its successor or asignee, will launch a Roton vehicle that 
 recrosses the launch meridian or lands not more than ten minutes of
 longitude west of the launching site after circling the Earth at
 least once without an intervening landing and in less than two hours
 from the time of launch.
 
 A Roton vehicle shall be defined as one which ascends to orbit
 without staging or use of jettisonable boosters, using for primary
 launch thrust a rotary rocket engine in which centrifugal effects of
 the engine's rotation replace high pressure pumps, whether or not the 
 current (as of March 1999) helicopter landing scheme is retained.
 There is no requirement that the vehicle carry any payload or
 pilot(s). It is irrelevant whether the vehicle reenters the Earth's
 atmosphere, intact or otherwise.

Claim ID:      seal
Creation Date: 1996/01/20
Due Date:      2035/01/01

 
    The Mediterranean Monk Seal (monachus monachus) will be extinct by the
    end of the year 2034. This will be judged true if marine biologists
    considered it to be at least 90% certain that there are no living
    specimens of the species remaining either in captivity or in the wild
    at any time before the end of the year 2034. If biologists have stored
    eggs, sperm, embryos or DNA in a frozen or otherwise suspended state
    with a possibility of reviving the species in the future, these would
    not be considered living specimens for the purposes of this claim.
    Furthermore, the claim can be judged true before 2034 even if there
    remains a possibility of reviving the species from frozen specimens
    before 2034. I.e. the species will be considered to have become
    extinct even if it is later revived. If there is a single animal
    remaining alive until the end of 2034 then the claim will be judged
    false even if it is a male and there is no further hope of saving the
    species. The Mediterranean Monk Seal is listed in the top 20 of
    endangered species at

    This claim will be judged true if before 2003/1/1 a new developing
    nation launches a satellite using its own launch capacity. For
    purposes of this claim, "Developing Nation" includes all countries
    that are not in Europe, the Former Soviet Union, China, Canada, United
    States, New Zealand, Australia, Israel, Japan, Taiwan, North Korea or
    South Korea(or new nations formed out of territories in these
    countries at the time this claim was written). India usually included
    among developing nations but since India has already launched a
    satellite another launch from India will not satisfy this claim. For
    purposes of this claim, [1]Mark's Wade's Encyclopedia Astronautica
    will be used as an authoritative source to determine both the country
    implementating a launch system and whether the system has in fact
    launched a satellite(in the case of North Korea, the Korean team
    claimed a successful satellite launch but this was not recognized by
    Enclopedia Astronautica). Traditionally, Encyclopedia Astronautica has
    listed the country of origin of all launch systems. In the case of a
    joint projects, only one country must be a developing nation for this
    claim to be true. The supplementary comments in Enclopedia
    Astronautica about the source of a launch systems technology will not
    be used for purposes of this claim(i.e. The SR-3 " was developed with
    the assistance of Israel and is believed to be essentially identical
    to the Israeli Jericho missile/Shavit launch vehicle" but the country
    listed in Encyclopedia Astronautica is South Africa so it would be
    considered a South African rocket for purposes of this claim and its
    use to launch a satellite would satisfy the intent of this claim.) In
    the event Encyclopedia Astronautica is no longer published, the judge
    may substitute a similarly authoritative source. Background: Recently
    North Korea has announced its intention to launch a satellite. The CIA
    has alleged that this launch system uses technology obtained from
    China--and that the North Korean launch may constitute a special
    security risk to the United States. The intent of this claim is to
    assess whether other teams in the developing world will soon obtain
    similar capacity. Representatives of the US CIA have admitted publicly
    that they underestimated North Korea's rocketry capability in a Sept.
    1998 [2]article published by the Washington Post. "So far, the Clinton
    administration is still holding to the policy that it will be at least
    the year 2010 to 2015 before another nation can threaten U.S.
    territory with ballistic missiles." according to a September 1998
    [3]article published by the Associated Press and Reuters.
