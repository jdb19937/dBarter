Installation Instructions For Barter 0.1
----------------------------------------

If you do not have the GNU C Compiler, you will probably need to
install it (ftp://ftp.gnu.org).

If you are not on an ix86-linux system, you will need to obtain and
compile Berkeley DB >= 2.7.5 (http://www.sleepycat.com) and the
GNU Multi-Precision Arithmetic Library >= 2.02 (ftp://ftp.gnu.org).
Install the static libraries in the "lib" directory as "libdb.a"
and "libgmp.a" respectively.

Now type "make install" and hopefully things will go smoothly.

(If it doesn't work, proceed old-school-style with Makefile and header
file inspection and modification.  Would anyone like to write an
autoconf script?)
