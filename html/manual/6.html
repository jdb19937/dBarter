<h3>Modeling Your Business With Barter</h3>

<hr>

<p>
Many kinds of value can be encoded into Barter denominations, but the
best way to do this isn't always obvious.
</p>

<p>
A common case is when you have a product or service that is
delivered upon redemption of a denomination representing it.  For
example, you're Pizza Hut.  You want to use Barter to establish
a secondary market on pizzas.  One way to do it would be to
create a denomination for every possible type of pizza that 
someone might order, e.g.:
</p>

<ul>
<li>pizzalarge_pepperoni_extracheese
<li>pizzalarge_pepperoni_mushroom
<li>pizzasmall_mushroom_sausage
<li>pizzasmall_mushroom_sausage_pepperoni_anchovies_extracheese
<li>...
</ul>

<p>
As you can see, this can quickly get out of hand.  Every time you add
a new topping you'll have to double the number of denominations!
And you'll have to convert all pizza types into canonical forms 
to avoid the confusion between <code>pizzasmall_mushroom_sausage</code>
and <code>pizzasmall_sausage_mushroom</code>.
</p>

<p>
A better way to model this would be to use more than one denomination.
The value of a pizza can be additively decomposed into component values:
it's the base price for a pizza of a certain size, plus charges
for each extra topping.  So you can get by with just the following
denominations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>pizza_small
<li>pizza_medium
<li>pizza_large
<li>mushrooms
<li>pepperoni
<li>sausage
<li>anchovies
<li>extracheese
</ul>

<p>
When a user wants to request delivery on a pizza, he can send a message
to Pizza Hut with a signed note containing a portfolio with a
pizza size denomination and a set of topping denominations.  The
pizza size denominations and the topping denominations can now be
sold and priced seperately.  This technique works for any product
or service whose value can be additively decomposed.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, however, a product or service will have value components
that do not combine additively.  For example, say you wanted to farm
out CPU time on the internet.  One customer might want to rent
100 CPUs in parallel for 10 hours, while another customer might want
a single CPU for 1000 hours.  The total CPU time is the same but
both services may be priced very differently.  So the price of 
CPU time is a function of two variables (total CPU time and number
of CPUs).
</p>

<p>
In cases such as this where the price of the service is a function
of two variables, say X and Y, Barter can approximate the
price with a piecewise linear function.  The idea is to create a
number of denominations, each of which is associated with a
different value of the ratio X / Y.  For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>CPU_1
<li>CPU_10
<li>CPU_100
<li>CPU_1000
<li>...
</ul>

<p>
Each of these denominations would be redeemable for a total of 1 hour
of CPU time split up between the specified number of CPUs (1, 10, 100, ...).
Portfolios of CPU time that fall between the lines can still be constructed:
for example, if you acquire a CPU_1 and a 10 CPU_10s, you now have an
hour of CPU time on each of 11 CPUs.
