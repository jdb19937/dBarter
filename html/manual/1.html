<h3>What is Barter?</h3>

<hr>

<p>
Barter is a simple way for people to create and exchange value.
</p>

<p>
Value creation is similar to money creation in that someone creates 
a transferable promise of some sort.  All similar promises belong to
the same "denomination" of value.  In normal money the promise is
something like "I, the Victorian era Bank of England, will give a 
pound of sterling silver to the bearer of one of this denomination upon 
its return to any of my offices."  A denomination can also have the
same behavior as other financial instruments, such as insurance
claims, mortage bonds, coupons, stock certificates, etc.
</p>

<p>
In any case, there are, presumably, some people somewhere who value
the promise and are therefore willing to give up something of their
own in order to acquire some quantity of the associated denomination.
If what they give up is a quantity of another denomination, "barter" 
occurs.
</p>

<p>
Value transfer is similar to money payment in that someone gives
value to someone else.
</p>

<p>
To be precise, what is transferred is a bunch of values, possibly of
various denominations, called a portfolio.  To be even more precise,
what is transferred is a note for a portfolio.  A note is created
by withdrawing a portfolio from an account.  The note is mailed to
another account.  The note is then deposited by the other account
thereby cancelling the note.
</p>

<p>
For example, Bob withdraws 15 Amazon Dollars, 10 eBay Dollars and
50 Bob Dollars creating a note.  Bob signs the note over to Cindy
and mails it to her.  Cindy then deposits the note in her account.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the Barter Server:
</p>

<ul>
<li> allows banker accounts to create other accounts of any type.
<li> allows denominating accounts to create new denominations.
<li> allows accounts to withdraw notes, which can be sent via mail.
<li> lets accounts send mail to other accounts electronically.
<li> allows accounts to deposit notes.
<li> keeps a history of all of these activities.
</ul>

<p>
All steps that might be vulnerable to fraud are protected by public
key encryption.
