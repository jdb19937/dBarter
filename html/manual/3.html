<h3>The Barter Server</h3>

<hr>

<p>
The Barter Server, once compiled and installed, can be invoked with the
<code>barterd.start</code> command, installed by default in
<code>/usr/local/barter/bin</code>.  It can be shutdown with
<code>barterd.stop</code>.  These two programs are simply shell
scripts and invoke <code>barterd</code> with certain default parameters,
so you may wish to edit them.
</p>

<p>
When the Barter Server is running, you can telnet to it.  By default
it is configured to run on port <code>1134</code>.  You will notice
that every message it sends back to you is in the following format:
</p>

<pre>
[3-digit code] [human-readable description of code's meaning]
[data, can be multiple lines or empty]
.
</pre>

<p>
The 3-digit code determines the meaning and context of the message.
You can see the symbolic names for these codes defined in the include
file <code>bif.h</code>.
</p>

<p>
Commands that are sent to the server are simply command names with
space-delimeted argument lists.  Here are a few examples you can try:
</p>

<pre>
denom_create foobar
denom_read foobar
user_create nothing
user_read nothing
balance
event_send nothing Hello+Mr.+Nothing
</pre>

<p>
However, you will probably find it more convenient to interact with
the Barter Server via the Perl client API.  The module to use is
<code>bif::client</code>.  It contains methods for all of the Barter
Server commands as well as some wrappers to simplify compound operations
(like authentication).
