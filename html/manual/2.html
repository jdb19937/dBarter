<h3>Barter Objects</h3>

<hr>

<p>
Barter's functionality centers around a few basic object types:
<i>denominations</i>, <i>users</i>, <i>notes</i>, <i>events</i>,
<i>values</i>, and <i>portfolios</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Denominations</i> are the units of value.  They can be created
by any user with appropriate permissions.  A denomination
has the following attributes: <i>issuer</i> (the user which created
it) and <i>profile</i> (a text string describing its meaning).
</p>

<p>
<i>Users</i> are accounts on the Barter Server.  Users have
the following attributes: <i>flags</i> (set of permissions flags),
<i>public</i> (the user's public key, an integer), <i>secret</i>
(the user's secret key, an integer), <i>modulus</i> (the user's
modulus, also an integer), and a portfolio that the server
recognizes the user's ownership of.  The server does not need
to know the value of <i>secret</i>, but any client applications
will need this information.
</p>

<p>
<i>Notes</i> are instruments of value transfer.  They have the
following attributes: <i>portfolio</i> (a portfolio that the
note contains), <i>challenge</i> (a random integer used for
signing the note), and <i>issuer</i> (the user that created it).
A user can use the <code>note_withdraw</code> command to
create a note.  The user specifies a portfolio in the command,
which becomes the <i>portfolio</i> of the note and is deducted
from the user's account balance.  To deposit a note, a user
must have its <i>signature</i> which the issuer produces by signing
the <i>challenge</i> of the note using his secret key.  Then
the depositor uses the <code>note_deposit</code> command to
transfer the portfolio of the note into his own account.
So if user <b>A</b> wants to transfer a portfolio <b>P</b> to
user <b>B</b>, <b>A</b> must first withdraw a note containing
<b>P</b>, sign it, then communicate the note's identity and
signature to <b>B</b> who can then deposit it.  More complex
schemes can also be created, such as re-encrypting the signature
of the note with the public key of its intended recipient.
</p>

<p>
<i>Events</i> are the temporal units of the Barter Server.  Every
event has a unique serial number, starting from 1 and going up.
Events have the following attributes: <i>time</i> (Epochal time of
its creation), <i>users</i> (a list of users who have permission
to see this event), <i>type</i> (a string representing what kind
of event this is: e.g., "user_create", "note_destroy"), and
<i>data</i> (a hash of attributes whose meaning is dependent on
the type of the event).  Users can also use events as a communications
device, using the <code>event_send</code> command, which works
a lot like email.  An event can be created and made visible to
any user containing an arbitrary message.  The preferred way
for users to exchange value is by communicating notes through
the <code>event_send</code> command.
</p>

<p>
<i>Values</i> are simply (denomination, quantity) pairs.  A "quantity"
is simply any non-negative rational number.  So a value is just some
amount of some thing.  "A third of all the IBM stock" or "$52.40".
</p>

<p>
<i>Portfolios</i> are simply sets of values.  The canonical form of
a portfolio contains at most one value of each denomination.
