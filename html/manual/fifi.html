<code>A Brave Old World</code>
</font></b>

<p>
With the Internet becoming an increasingly more attractive medium of
exchange for many different kinds of businesses, it is becoming
equally attractive to find solutions to the problems in finance
and financial software that are holding back more automation and
consumer selection.
</p>

<p>
High costs of access to electronic financial services prevent many
would-be small Internet businesses from entering the market.  Credit
card debt is dangerous, since issuers must redeem the costs of
fraudulent purchases to consumers.  This cost ultimately gets
passed back to merchants in the form of large downpayments and
high transaction fees.  A related problem is that the security of
credit cards lies almost entirely in the virtue of one very gregarious
number; this weak security model makes fraud simple and common,
contributing to costs.
</p>

<p>
Alternative payment systems such as
<a href="http://www.firstvirtual.com">First Virtual</a> and
<a href="http://www.egold.com">E-Gold</a> seem to be dead
or struggling.  Phone-based billing systems (900-numbers) are still
in use but have a tainted reputation because of inconvenience and
unaccountability.  Credit cards are apparently the only viable
option for business-to-consumer transactions on the Internet.
</p>

<p>
There are many sites on the Internet that have a lot in common
with these payment systems and each other.  Stock brokers like
<a href="http://www.datek.com/">Datek</a> and
<a href="http://www.etrade.com/">E*Trade</a> keep track of
the contents of and modifications to their customers'
stock portfolios, much the same as your bank keeps track of your
credit card balance and processes transactions against it.
</p>

<p>
Other businesses issue promises or coupons to their customers --
some might even permit them to be traded or redeemed online.
This process of keeping track of "who's got what and why" is
fundamental to all of the software systems mentioned previously.
But this common core of functionality is frequently reimplemented
with proprietary protocols which differ in both syntax and semantics
despite exterior similarity.  This lack of protocol uniformity and
the problem of access to financial services have made many business
concepts impractical.  An open, distributed, and well-written
financial infrastructure would create a lot of new possibilities
if widely adopted, and at the very least would provide a solid
development base for new financial applications.
</p>

<p>
DBarter
is a possible solution to some of these problems.  It defines
a simple way to create quantified and transferable electronic promises   
that are communicated to a user through a web browser or to another
computer through a simple cross-platform API.  It can perform
most of the basic operations found in the systems described
above -- electronic checks, trading value, creating new kinds
of value, etc.  And unlike a credit card, RSA encryption is
used for security, making fraud somewhat more difficult.
</p>

<hr><b><font size="+1"><code>Conceptual Overview</code></font></b>

<p>
In the real world, value is usually represented by discrete categories:
$, &yen;, Microsoft common stock, February orange juice futures, sorted
boxes of uncollected car loans, and other types of commoditized contracts.
Certain sets of these categories are called currencies, commodities,
bonds, options, etc.  DBarter uses the catch-all term <i>denomination</i> 
for any such type of value, and allows these denominations to be
held or exchanged in any rational-number quantity (or optionally
an integral multiple of a unit of configurable size).  DBarter does
not regulate the semantics of its denominations: they are created
and defined by accounts on the system who can implement client-side
tools to enforce the backing value of their DBarter denominations.
</p>

<p>
Every account on the system has a <i>portfolio</i> which is a set of
denominations paired with their respective quantities.  Value can be
withdrawn from these portfolios and converted into transferrable
objects called <i>notes</i> which can have the intuitive
characteristics of both cash and bank checks.
</p>

<p>
DBarter also allows accounts to create <i>offers</i> which are
promises to trade some quantity of one denomination for some
quantity of another.  An offer is automatically executed when a
viable counter-offer is made.
</p>

<p>
So far only the mechanics of representing and transferring value
have been discussed.  A more important question is: how can one
specify the protocol through which an <i>underlying</i> value is
transferred?  For example, stock-holders are entitled to 
vote on company issues, owners of annuities receive regular
payments, and the proud holder of McDonald's gift certificate
deserves a free Big Mac.  DBarter attacks this issue by implementing
a simple communications framework.  Messages can be sent to other
accounts and transactionally bound with other server operations,
simplifying the creation of value redemption protocols.
</p>

<p>
One can use messaging for many other purposes as well -- e.g., it
is possible to "move" value from an account on one DBarter system
to an account on another by having a representation of that value
on both systems and a trusted intermediary account who will trade a
note containing the remote value in exchange for a note containing
the local value.
</p>

<hr><b><font size="+1"><code>Implementation and Summary</code></font></b>

<p>
DBarter can be useful in isolation, by providing developers of
back-end financial software with an abstract foundation.  And
it can be even more useful when deployed across multiple
businesses, since the common protocol implements a framework
for trade and communication.  Imagine being able to participate
in inter-auction arbitrage, create your own unique financial
derivatives, or filter spam by charging five cents for each
email message received.  This sort of interoperability is what
we hope that DBarter can ultimately help create.
</p>

<p>
But in order to achieve this, we need more than a good design --
we need an efficient, reliable, and recoverable software product.
DBarter 0.1, our first free release for Unix, aims to meet all of
these criteria.  It includes a core server written in C++
(<code>barterd</code>), and a client-side API written in Perl to
simplify WWW integration.  BerkeleyDB 2.7.5 is used for data
storage and transaction integrity, GMP for arithmetic and
cryptographic routines, and POSIX threads for scalability.
The server protocol is designed to be simple to understand
and reimplement in other environments if necessary.  An example
WWW application is included, which clones the functionality
of <a href="http://www.ideosphere.com/">Ideosphere</a> with
a very simple set of Perl CGI scripts.
