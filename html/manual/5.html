<h3>The Barter Perl API</h3>

<hr>

<p>
Barter comes with three Perl modules to make interacting with the server
as easy as possible. All of them come with the standard installation.
</p>

<hr>
<h4><code>dmath</code></h4>
<p>
Using <code>dmath</code> will give you access to the following packages:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>dmath::bz</code> -- an integer class
<li><code>dmath::bq</code> -- a rational number class
</ul>

<p>
<code>dmath::bz</code> is used for representing RSA keys, and
<code>dmath::bq</code> is used for representing quantity.  The
functions <code>rsa_keygen</code> and <code>rsa_crypt</code>
will also be exported.
</p>

<hr>
<h4><code>bom</code></h4>

<p>
Using <code>bom</code> will give you access to the following packages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>bom::denom
<li>bom::user
<li>bom::note
<li>bom::event
<li>bom::value
<li>bom::portfolio
<li>bom::txn
</ul>

<p>
Essentially, the same objects covered in section 1., with the addition
of the txn (transaction) object which facilitates local database
transactions.  The objects also know how to store themselves and
their relationships on disk, using the same BerkeleyDB interface
that the server itself uses.  In order to use a database, you
must call <i>bom_db_init</i> with a database directory as its
argument. Well-behaved programs also call <i>bom_db_exit</i>
upon termination.
</p>

<hr>
<h4><code>bif</code></h4>

<p>
Using <code>bif</code> will give you access to the following packages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>bif::client
</ul>

<p>
<code>bif::client</code> allows you to talk to the Barter server.
Its methods are the same as the server command names, but all
arguments and return values are converted from/to the appropriate
types defined in <code>bom</code>.
